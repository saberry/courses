1,"Firstly, the company culture and the people are fantastic - it is unlike anywhere else that I have worked. The work is interesting and varied (typical projects last about 5 weeks) and everyone is incredibly smart. REDACTED has been the continuous learning curved that I had hoped it would be.Secondly, the Frome office is ideal for me - it gives me the chance to live in the countryside around Bath and still work a London-style job. I was slightly apprehensive about leaving London at first, but I frequently work from the London office and travel up for client meetings. This provides the balance that I enjoy and I am unaware of any other consultancies that provide a similar opportunity. Like any consultancy, the hours can be long and unpredictable, but REDACTED will give you a day or two off after a gruelling project. From time to time you may work on a project / in an industry that you do not find very interesting, but it comes with the territory. NA","W472V"
2,"You can stay forever with minimal efforts.Life is relaxing in support specific projects here.Heaven for managers. Low salaryNo hikeNo promotiongoing 1 level above will waste your 5-6 yearsNo growth opportunitiesMinimum stabilitysmall small project contracts will make your life completely unstable Kindly focus on your key employees & promote them to retain with you. Timely promotion or salary hikes can lure them to stay but unfortunately none of this is being focused currently except acquisitions or migrations. I would strongly ask REDACTED management to focus on there employees else you will lose your true dignity.","S227N"

Where can I start,They are pathological lairs.Upper management is in denial of their current situation & waiting for miracle.Haven't paid some of us in 4 month & still making excesses, how it going to be different every month.Management is constantly on vacation & driving around the most expensive car, when people are struggling to make it day to day.For what I know this company will be dissolving very soon.

9,"Easy work. Upper management micro manages way too much, but they are not invested in their employees at all. When plenty of other property managements offer better rewards. Salary is a joke. Bonuses are set up on a tier system that are affected by management and maintenance so it doesn't matter how much you lease. If one part of the team don't meet the numbers then everyone suffers. No room for real growth. Acknowledge the rising stars in the leasing. Stop treating them like the bottom of the totem pole and invest in people that prove themselves with dedication and hard work.","E201S"

I really do not have anything to say about this business. Everyone at SPMC was helpful, kind, and a privilege to work with. Work on phone efficiency. It was sometimes hard to get ahold of the main office.","P595S"
16,"Nothing. At least I can say I've been to Chicago now. Every ""lead"" they send you has been called many times before. They send you on appointments that do not exist. They lie to their prospects, they lie to you, they even lie to each other in the home office. If you don't mind being lied to and being instructed to lie to prospects, then by all means, jump right in and apply. Close the doors. Honest, upstanding people do not do business this way.","Z508S"
17,"The overall compensation package is very competitive. The firm made some excellent strategic decisions to remain afloat in a very difficult environment. The work is pretty interesting, and the people are awesome. Some of the great things about the firm are the accessibilty of partners and knowledge capital. They often talk about maintaining work-life balance. The fact is, there is no such thing. In order to over-deliver at the client and work on side projects(which you must do to get promoted), many colleagues end up putting in 100+ hours a week.The also talk about REDACTED being a transparent firm, I found this to not be the case either from partner leads (regarding my performance) or from leadership (regarding certain strategic decisions). Please practice what you preech regarding transparency.","O649Q"

20,"Flexible hours and vacation, food stocked, occasional company lunches or events. Friendly coworkers willing to help you as long as you can carry on your own too. Company will encourage and pay for certifications. Direction of the company is aimless as priorities shift or reverse course frequently. Culture is poisoned with negative attitudes and compromises of core values. Personal growth opportunities become limited after a while. Management is slow to react and has trouble understanding how people feel about work stresses. There is minimal focus on intangibles when evaluating employees. You must find a way to be more proactive and forward thinking and less reactive.Get a clearer vision for the company. When you try to be everything for every customer, and bend over backwards/change company processes/priorities at a whim to do so, you sacrifice true excellence and end up with confusion and mediocre work.The CEO must be more trusting of his team, their abilities, and experience, and be more clear and consistent in his expectations. Ultimately, he should be more willing to take more chances with letting his team take the lead in an area instead of trying to personally micromanage all areas.","P298G"

The client deliverable quality factor at REDACTED is outstanding. There is opportunity for fast promotion if you are able to sell. The company has been successful and is looking to continue to grow. The culture is still very ""old boys' club"" with a big focus on billable hours versus building an internal community/collegiality. Minimal work life balance, but that is to be expected from a service/client based industry. Continue to work on building the culture to stem some of the churn.","P292D"

27,"Able to recruit from top firms and build smart teams that are very capable and sell cool projects Terrible paternalistic, ultra conservative culture. Expectation that you bill 100% of your time except for your paid time off while also producing marketing material, writing articles, meeting new clients, and selling work. Most other firms recognize that you have to reduce the amount of billable time when you increase expectations in other areas. Really poor leadership and communication as evidenced by the recent overnight dismissal of the marketing department or laying off 25 kurt salmon employees after making public announcements denying that it was happening. What was an old boys club culture that felt like an abusive law firm from the 80s has gotten even worse. Salary and benefits are not competitive. Leadership asks employees to post comments on social media about what a great place to work it is without actually doing anything to make it a better place to work. Actually, while taking actions that make it a significantly worse place to work. There used to be a big company retreat that everyone loved - the one fun thing we did every year! But leaders canceled it because it meant employees weren't billing clients those 2 days and they couldn't tolerate that. At my last job, the company gave us sweatshirts and mugs with corporate logos on it - free advertising for them, right? REDACTED has a store where you have to go buy the corporate sweatpants if you want them. Easily expect to work 12 hour days, often more. Remember that your employees are human beings and not profit widgets. Many of the decisions about how much employees should be working, how much you should pay them, what their benefits should be are very outdated, not competitive, and make leaders seem cheap.","K944D"
28,"The people in the company are great and there is a challenging range of projects to work on. The salary is not as competitive as other companies and benefits are not brilliant e.g. CH2MHill offer private health care with Bupa Invest in IT, new laptops and VPNs rather than Citrix. Need more dedicated business development personnel in Ireland.","Q312G"
29,"The core of the business could be good, unfortunately led by a senior management team that none of the staff trust.Flexible working practices, although more of a consequence of your line management than the company. Some good experienced staff rapidly being lost as they find better opportunities elsewhere.Terrible training opportunities, no payrise or benefits in 5 years. Degraded skills. Dont expect promotion even if you work hard.Dodgy senior management buy-out of the shareholders, staff lost money in our own company while the senior management benefitted. If Mr Rumbles had walked into a presentation I think he would get heckled thats how much people within the company view him and have confidence in his leadership. Consequently, not seen much of him.Poor progression and morale is bad. Again, senior management do not seem to care, as long as they can get the business to a state before they started to meddle they end up benefiting anyway, hence why do they care?Morale generally rock bottom, some of the people are fantastic though.Sadly I will leave once right position comes up as current pay levels around Â£8k under equivalent in area.

33,"The work can be quite challenging and therefore very interesting. Some of the software engineers are very good at mentoring junior developers. There is an extremely high turn over rate, at all levels, Senior Management, Software Engineers, HR and FSO. On-boarding is very disorganized and paperwork is lost or misplaced (including very sensitive personal information).Salary and benefits are mediocre given the volume of work individuals are expected to carry. There is no career growth, when openings occur, people are hired from external sources. There are a few senior engineers who are expected to mentor many junior engineers while maintaining a heavy workload, this leads to no work\life balance. People are expected to work many hours (more than 80 a week in some cases) and not always record these to maintain profit margins.Several senior managers have never supervised anyone and are placed into these positions without any training. This has led to quite a bit of tension between engineers and program managers. Several micro-manage while others are completely hands-off, there is needs to be more of middle of the road approach so engineers have consistency across projects. Hire an outside consulting firm, that is non-biased, to evaluate better management techniques and ways to improve morale and reduce the turn-over rate.","V190W"

45,"There are some good, dedicated people who deliver despite everything. REDACTED is weighed down by archaic systems and software and doesn't really offer a differentiator to the market.Finance rules everything which is understandable to some extent, but it should be tempered by the realisation of what REDACTED is supposed to be there for. There are a lot of people who have all but given up and are sick of living in a world of instability and initiatives Do something decisive and then stick to it.Consulttations and initiatives have their place but you can have too much of a good thing.REDACTED used to have a good name as a civil engineering consultancy. Now we are a just about OK one","Z380H"
46,"Used to be a great place to work for. Since the takeover through REDACTED a few year back, the company has lost its way and become just an extended arm of the mega-outsourcing behemoth that is REDACTED. In fact, the name ""Lodestone"" is already gone, and the company is now only called ""REDACTED Consulting"".When I joined, I asked whether the culture would change from its European roots, and the partner said that the consulting branch would always be treated differently from the main AMS and Development departments. Well, that partner is now gone, together with most of the other good people that used to work there. Most of the former Lodestone senior leadership is gone, too. Administration and IT was successively moved to India, with disastrous results for productivity and efficiency of basic functions like invoicing and timesheet management. Bit by bit, ridiculous kindergarten rules were introduced with regards to procedures and processes. Those may be required to keep fresh-grads in India under control but are totally useless and insulting to senior consulting staff. Finally, performance reviews were slowly changed towards rewarding the ""appearance of effort"" (such as spending long times in the office or doing cherry-picked jobs for the boss instead of real project work or helping colleagues). That means that even if you worked off your butt for a client, you might just end up in the middle of the bell curve and score an ""average"" final performance result, with accordingly negative effects on your bonus and promotion chances.Conclusion: If you like micromanagement, byzantine processes, inefficiencies, and cronyism, this might be a good place to work at now. But if you were looking for management and IT consulting excellence, a relaxed European mindset that rewards responsibility and client-focused work, stay away. Speaking to people who have recently left or are still working there, morale among ex-Lodestone folks has slowly reached rock bottom. Return to the roots of what made Lodestone a globally successful company and respected name. But I think management is actually fully committed to the cultural shift occurring there, so such advice is rather futile.","D558Z"

Also it is a very open firm with easy access to Partners. I met some truly exceptional consultants. Lack of name recognition. During client engagements, most employees had not heard about REDACTED. In many instances client employees asked whether it was a contracting firm. REDACTED is notorious for lack of organized training. If you are lucky enough to be on a good project with an experienced Partner you will learn a lot. It was very difficult for me to find previous work or intellectual property I could leverage for client work. As a result, I had to rely on the web or reinvent again. I didn't see a lot of fresh thinking or truly ground breaking intellectual capital come out of the firm. That may be a result of the culture where every Partner is so focused on client delivery that true intellectual property is not developed. I saw come proposals that used material from proposals developed 10-15 years ago. Focus on training and skills development of consultants.","U339N"

56,"For starters, I spent nine long and personally fulfilling years at REDACTED. The exposure, learning and opportunities provided were invaluable. REDACTED provides its employees an opportunity to work across diverse industries and sectors, across its full practice offering and provides opportunity for travel and project work across multiple countries. It also grooms and provides exposure for client interaction at CEO and Board level. All of this truly broadens one's perspective and is immensely enriching and satisfying. Personally, I was provided an opportunity to execute projects across 15 countries over my nine years at REDACTED and have gained knowledge, exposure and expertise across diverse sectors such as Energy, Manufacturing, Retail, Real Estate, Education, BFSI and Government to name just a few. Another very strong plus of REDACTED is that one cannot ever be part of an organization that is as apolitical as REDACTED is. One of the reasons is that employee growth and rewards are based on pure meritocracy in the organization. Also, REDACTED has an open and transparent culture with everyone on first name basis and no barriers of communication across hierarchical levels. All in all a super place to work for those with a good mind and a passion for learning. No negatives in particular. Like any other consulting firm, REDACTED is not for those seeking a 9-5 job nor for those averse to travel. Many ex-employees have gained tremendously from REDACTED and have reached great heights in their professional careers. Forming an alumni association to get them on a common platform would be a great idea.","T921J"

119,"REDACTED is a rapidly growing firm with tremendous market opportunities. Although the firm has many competencies on the provider side of healthcare, there are many untapped areas where ambitious associates can build a practice area. The firm promotes an entrepreneurial culture that, when managed appropriately, leads to great innovation and immense satisfaction among its associates.Individuals who can push through the late nights and days on the road are rewarded at the upper levels with generous bonus plans that reward the hungry and ambitious. Staff are treated well with in-office meals, fully stocked refrigerators and snacks, private offices, and social opportunities.Talent at the firm is top-notch. This is no place for individuals who like to be comfortable. You are usually surrounded by the best and the brightest. Someone is always pushing to get further than previously reached. That keeps smart individuals on their toes but sharp elbows can also hinder progress of others. Rapid growth has eroded the traditional culture of the firm which may not be an overall negative. The firm has nearly doubled in the last two years, largely through a series of acquisitions and strategic senior hires. Much focus has been placed on these individuals and groups who have brought considerable but narrow expertise in specific practice areas. The addition of so many outside leaders without corresponding junior staff have led to a top-heavy structure.The delivery model has changed from a regional/generalist one to a national/specialist structure and a number of senior staff have been caught in the transition as reporting relationships and client focuses are shuffled. Some have benefitted while other have found themselves fighting to regain position or find a new area of focus.The continued insistence on an office-based culture that is becoming increasingly irrelevant is frustrating to some. Many beautiful offices sit relatively empty throughout the week as project managers and project officers travel or live away from office locations. This leaves junior staff often working alone in a quiet lonely office for days at a time. Much of the dollar investment on space could be redirected elsewhere if hoteling were to be implemented in offices where average daily occupancy is low. Invest the time and money to continue to build the culture. Focus on creating a workplace and work style that will still be relevant in 10-15 years. Seek to recruit and retain mid-level talent to support projects.","M377C"

Insane hours, and the up-or-out work culture makes it very, very hard because in every project, there is always someone without a life willing to put in 120 hours each week. It makes the others look bad in comparison since all banding at REDACTED is relative. This is particularly hard on folks with families and children, or those who are staffed to local projects.There is a move away from strategy and into execution, which makes it hard for people looking to do real management consulting.It is also very hard to switch competencies or verticals. Your interests and background are NOT taken into consideration. Staffing is a complete black box -- ""You're staffed here, and you'd better take it or leave."" Zero transparency and zero regard for people's wishes. This is made worse by the fact that people are staffed at projects for several years at a time. Bring in more people to projects -- a lot more. This will greatly help address the work-life balance issue.Weed out the incompetence at the top.Please move away from execution and into core strategy.Please provide more transparency into staffing. Nobody wants to work at a client with the same obnoxious people for over 3 years. It completely defeats the purpose of consulting.

The firm is small enough (35 consulting staff) that the project pipeline dictates what projects you will be staffed on, sometimes without much room for personal preferences.

My background in Nursing prepared me well and I really enjoy being on the business side of healthcare. The CEO is intelligent, inclusive, and has a unique vision for healthcare recruitment. I enjoy working for him and see myself as a long-term employee.The compensation package and benefits are generous. The commission plan is competitive, the more time that passes, the more money you make. My sales grew dramatically after year one when I felt really established and have continued to climb at a steady rate. There are fun sales contests and incentives throughout the year.The schedule is a typical 9-5 which I enjoy as I used to work nights and weekends as a nurse. The team has really grown this year and the office space is getting a little snug although we are looking for a larger space currently. I hope to stay in the neighborhood.

That, combined with a lack of leadership (in terms of setting a good example and professionalism) amongst the partners and managerial staff, leads to an unpleasant atmosphere in the office.

Both bearing a lot of flaws.Hourly and salaried compensation is above average which is good! Absolutely money hungry. They charge up the apartments far past the market average without consideration for the age or condition of the property. This puts a lot of stress on the on-site staff.Additionally, the bonus structure is dependent upon far too many factors. Commissions are reduced for any reason. You expect $50 for each move-in but you're left with $15 if they don't move-in almost immediately. You expect a $1,500 quarterly bonus but you're left with $500 if you go a cent over any of your budget line items.Upper management would rather force an applicant in to an apartment in order to increase occupancy without any concern for their 'preferred' move-in date. Leaving the applicant feeling pressured and unhappy.It is without question that little to no money is put back in to the property. Our budgets are shallow and prevent flexibility. So you're left with an old rickety property and no money to fix it.Again, this company seeks out the most financially beneficial route rather than the happy resident route.Write-ups are distributed for work related occurrences. Can't meet delinquency goals? Well you will be written up.I've never worked for a company that is so scattered and unorganized. You will never utilize a company specific form.

Company has very little internal politics.2) Great Exposure - new recruits are often asked to attend management meetings and presentations to Private Equity clients.3) Detailed Training - training includes soft and hard skills covering primary & secondary research skills, powerpoint presentation skills and in-depth excel skills.4) Fantastic Boss - Sebastian Chambers listens and makes time for everyone's opinion.5) Exciting Work - the work is very varied, you never stop learning about a new quirk in a market.6) Fast Growing - the company is growing fast, which makes working there and exciting place to be with a strong team ethic.7) Skills - the skills developed at REDACTED gives anyone the perfect platform to perform incredibly well in their next role.8) Great Platform - REDACTED gives anyone a perfect platform to move into their next role; whether it be Private Equity, Corporate Finance, Corporate Strategy or anything else.

The compensation is high and the offices are (mostly) located in desirable locations. Work/life balance is almost non-existent and the company has become internally competitive as upper level (senior manager) consultants are financially incentivized to work against each other. The turnover rate among junior staff (senior consultants) has increased significantly, and the firm's partners seem unaware of or uninterested in the driving forces behind it. 1) Not every good consultant makes a good manager. Consolidate administrative management responsibilities under a few good senior managers/principals and let the rest of your senior managers focus on being good consultants.2) Realign the incentive structure to reduce the carnage of the current internal competition among the senior managers.","P487L"

As with any consulting firm, experience can be highly dependent on project staffing. Additionally, travel can range from 0% to 100% - either scenario can be a pro or con depending on personal preferences.

If you value your sanity, your time, and your blood pressure, run from this joke of a company.

320,"REDACTED is an extremely high quality firm with very satisfied clients. The best part about working here is the quality of the consultants around you. Everyone is extremely intelligent and passionate about their work. Projects are typically interesting, complicated, and leading edge in terms of the industry.Opportunities for promotion are significant. REDACTED is an historically small firm and has had trouble scaling in recent years to a large firm with multiple locations, broad services, and limited culture. There is very little HR support in terms of the annual review process and promotion criteria differ significantly from manager to manager. Work life balance is limited at best with client deadlines pushed to the forefront and often poor planning leads to weekend work sessions and all night deliverable preparation.Travel can be significant (Mon-Thur) for months at a time in some cases but more typically this job is a lonely desk job in a private office where office socializing is discouraged in favor of billing time.Culture is poorly defined and lags behind similar firms in terms of team building, trust, and transparent promotion process. Instead of one company with a strong central culture the feeling among employees is more of individuals working on individual projects with random levels of oversight and limited collaboration. REDACTED does a poor job of developing ""4 star"" talent into 5 star talent. In other words, individuals that would succeed anywhere do well at REDACTED but anyone that might be a 5 star with a little development rarely receives the development they need and typically leave. Simply, the culture of the organization is not set up to allow for the scaling planned.My advice would be to invest in culture building outside of traditional methods (summer conference, occasional social events). Instead, backlog professional develop hours for office lunches, mentoring, etc. and create a culture that discourages employees from working during these sessions. Right now, the culture set by leadership is one that expects consultants to work during all division meetings, late nights, and weekends all in the interest of client work, even if formal announcements say otherwise. This culture will not scale or retain talent.Invest in knowledge sharing and the development of consultants with targeted training and formal mentoring sessions with leaders across the firm. Enforce consistent management processes across all practices and managers and increase HR function to bring formality and professionalism to the people planning strategy.","Z620A"

This company used to have really good people working here, 90% of them left. Some groups do not value team work at all - it's just not part of their culture to collaborate and to try to do that is seen as a huge negative. Getting ahead for them means to not think but just appear to always be working. Very backward thinking. It's a shame because it really used to be a good place to work -> 6-8 years ago.

A common mistake that I did, and many others did. This is a highly muddled up organisation, which has absolutely no business clarity or process structure. They are superbly confused as to what their core competency even is. They identify themselves as a boutique management consulting firm even after 15 years since inception. The research work is very base level and is merely reorganisation of data found via google searches, the credibility of which has always remained questionable. Not to forget the extremely unethical bit of reusing projects for a client to another - something that is in fact legally sue-able! Its whistle-blowing waiting to happen!My advise to prospective employees is : Please carry out a sound research on the organisation before joining in / applying. Connect with folks who have worked with the organisation and learn more, before you decide to jeopardise your career. Do not fall prey to some of the fake positive reviews that you would see on this page! The attrition rate (of ~50-55%) is incredibly high for a reason; theres always vacancies at REDACTED. Every 6 months everyone gets either a 'fast track' or a promotion! Some of the rosy salaries they offer are disguises in blessings. It makes it nearly impossible to expect a hike in your next job / or a job in the first place! My personal experience has been torturous, and it did affect my personal well-being to quite an extent. And I am clearly not referring to work pressures (which we youngsters must adapt to for our own good anyway) but the psychological trauma due to office politics and favouritism and lack of recognition to your work. Two-faced people. passing negative feedback to your managers, hampering your repute is an everyday thing here! The organisation has now become a headless chicken - with 4 heads. Heavily confused, with no end in sight. Poor leaders making poor decisions, that too aggressively! Previous comments have already stated about the lack of vision and mission! The head sitting in US office, has eternally been an inside joke in India office. Please please buckle up dear REDACTED, and stop ruining careers!Advice to Candidates:I have never seen Management of any organisation for that matter, reading these comments on glassdoor, going back and implementing it, to bring about a change. So, please avoid this company, even if you dont have any other prospective opportunities!","I365O"

Received my so-called leads on Saturday. All lead cards read with positive messages such as: ""he is excited you're local"", ""he's anticipating the meeting"", ""they are open to the discussion"", ""they'd love to take advantage of what we have to offer"", etc. I drove 180 miles (to the appoinments and back home) that Monday. Of the 5 leads, I saw 1. He said he didn't get a call and is already sserviced by someone else. The other 4 were NO GOOD. Like the others said, you can complain to management but they'll tell you ""hang in there. You must have done something wrong."" The same every no is closer to a yes. Except in this setup every no is closer to you being broke (making NO $$$) and chased off the ""customers"" premises. I ended the relationship that Monday evening. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.

382,"FMC is a company made up of a group of driven and inspired people determined to not only make a success of the business, but make a success of each individual they hire. Alongside a competitive salary, there are numerous benefits and opportunities that come with working at FMC; training and development, bonuses, childcare vouchers, healthcare, company trips, fitness challenges and huge Christmas parties. My personal favourite activities have been completing Tough Mudder, climbing Snowdon and taking over a country manor for the mother of all house parties.My 3.5 years at FMC were incredibly positive; I moved from the recruitment team (8 months) into the marketing dept where I spent the remainder of my time. I was offered a lot of support during the transition, given 1-2-1 training with our systems providers and had regular meetings with my MD and manager. I was given the freedom to work on my own projects, could always ask for help when I needed it and always felt encouraged to do my best and given pep-talks when I lacked confidence, felt frustrated or had a lazy period. During periods where I would clash with my manager, we would resolve things in the boardroom and create plans of how to better work together, resulting in a strong team dynamic. Yes, in a sales environment there are KPI's and targets to meet, and if you fall below target you will be monitored, but you will be supported and get the help you need and ask for. The difference with FMC is that if you show willing, you will be given a chance to turn things around, for a much longer period than most companies would entertain.At FMC, you will find;- An informal, yet professional culture where you don't have to leave your personality at the door.- A team that works with professional integrity.- Positive reinforcement, training and development where needed.- Modern offices- An open-door whether you need help with your work, your specialism, or your personal life.- A team of really friendly, dynamic people who support each other, live together and socialise together giving the office a friendly/family environment. They celebrate each others successes, go to each others weddings and rally through difficult times. This is a very unique set of people who were wonderful to work with.- A Management Team and MD who genuinely care for your well-being, get to know you personally and understand how to help you with your weakness and build up your strengths.- Experienced professionals with specialised (and international) markets willing to teach you and develop you.- A professional ladder that is quick and easy to climb if you are willing to put the work in...graduates have been promoted to Account Managers in less than a year!During my time at FMC I had a great group of friends to work with, felt incredibly supported in pursuing my career goals and still maintain the positive relationships I built. It's hard to think of cons, sometimes parking is a little tricky and sales/ target driven environments aren't for everyone.Overall FMC were fantastic to work for and I would return in a heart beat.

They don't allow property workers to have pictures of their family in their office! They don't back their employees: they take advantage of their reliable, hard workers, and keep employees who call in to work so much so that the employee doesn't get paid because the sick time ran out. They make their supervisors exempt status so they can't get OT, but of course don't pay a supervisor salary. You will make less money with this company. When they take over your property, they also take away your vacation time. If you had 3 or 4 weeks, you drop down to 2 because they don't care about you and that you've been at the same property for over 5 years. They do nothing to support the managers at the property and make it impossible to get rid of the employees who don't show up to work. Which of course, the supervisor who gets paid minimal has to pick up the slack and has to constantly be away from their family just to take care of a property that is old and for a company who simply doesn't care.

484,"When I first interviewed for REDACTED / STEP STRATEGY and saw the Glassdoor Reviews, I wrongfully doubted the value of the summer internship program. However, after spending a summer with REDACTED / STEP STRATEGY,, I cannot thank Sharona and the team enough. As a University of Virginia student, I came into the program with some experience in a Series B start-up, but no management consulting experience. To my surprise, I was placed in a beautiful open office overlooking a mountain range in Brentwood, one of the most affluent neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California. On one of my first days I was taken on site to a credit retailer with over $600 million in annual revenue and worked with the principals on a systems analysis of the accounting, merchandising, floor planning, and customer relations systems. The office runs quite like a start-up company. Each intern comes from some of the most elite schools in the country and brings a unique perspective and network to the program. I had the privilege to pitch my own ideas to the principals of the firm, who have high profile connections to top CEOs in Los Angeles and Israel. When my ideas were determined valuable, I was given the freedom to work on my own projects throughout the summer, culminating in an event in August where we met C-Suite management in cutting edge virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming, entertainment, ad-tech, venture capital, angel investing, production, cybersecurity, and technology firms. Whether a high-growth start-up in Silicon Beach that just closed a $60M funding round or a billion-dollar established enterprise, I saw first-hand how Sharona commands the respect and admiration of power players in business. We even got to meet Yossi Vardi, the Godfather of IsraelÂ<U+0092>s hi-tech industry, which is now the second start-up ecosystem in the world with $2.8 billion invested in the first half of 2016 next to Silicon Valley. Yes, Sharona has high expectations for the work you deliver but these expectations were only to help the interns develop as professionals. I believe that the previous Glassdoor reviewers just may not have the ability to take constructive criticism and use it to inspire better work habits. Each day we have access to a kitchen filled with snacks and drinks. In fact, we either all go out for free lunch or order free lunch to the office, where we discuss recent M&A activity and business news over a meal. Bottom line is I appreciate Sharona for developing me professionally and turning an amateur management consultant to an analyst with contacts throughout the business world and experience with multi-million dollar clients. I would even recommend the program over a more well-known firm because the ability to work intimately with experienced PwC principals gave me more experience and access than I would have as just another intern at the bottom of the totem pole in a bigger firm. The need to adapt to constructive criticism. Keep hiring high power interns.","K940S"

Company is growing quickly, so some processes are not as efficient as they could be because they are still developing. During the period I worked here, there was some job overlap for certain individuals, so certain areas, like IT, were not operating as smoothly as they could be if there was a dedicated IT person or team to iron out issues. No real cons, just typical growing pains for a developing company. I enjoyed my time here and was sad to leave. I enjoyed the fact that the CEO and other executives took time to get to know every new employee.

The smart employees are very good and hard working helping their clients reach their goals. Leadership made promises to clients about their capabilities which were completely not true. That put their consultants in bad positions when they were on site with clients. REDACTEDanagement made it a habit to call the employees at all hours of the night (past 10pm) for non-essential items. The employees are treated like they are servants and are reminded how lucky they are to be taken in by them because they wouldn't be welcomed anywhere else. They had consultants billing for one job and billing for a second at the same time because the work load would have had us working all hours. They were very insincere to both their employees and clients. Approximately, 8 full time employees left REDACTED&S because of these reasons.

This is to some extent the name of the game in consulting, and I do not think REDACTED is worse than its peers in this respect, but it could still be managed better.Limited input on staffing - you might not be put on projects which you feel are most interesting or would most further your career.

It can be hard to plan a weeknight social life due to the unpredictable nature of our work.

753,"AMC has been acquiring properties to manage left and right, so the growth opportunity is very positive and probable. AMC likes to promote within, so opportunities come available sooner than you may think. The office culture is very casual and friendly; you won't find upper management in 3 piece suits and refusing to speak to the ""little people"", aka the ""assistants and leasing staff."" It's great to work for a company that actually follows and maintains the ""open door"" policy. Upper management is very approachable, and definitely serves as true mentors in your career. I have been extremely fortunate to work under (in my opinion..) the absolute best Regional Manager, ever. Being able to express my concerns, asking for career guidance, requesting more challenging opportunities, and even just being able to vent about reports has been great. Even with having one of the largest portfolios in the company, this RPM has made sure to tend to each and every property AND employee with the utmost attention, and in a very timely manner. Be it 6am, or 11pm, and you need some assistance with your duties, the RPM makes them self available and values your effort, drive, dedication, and even perfectionist persona.The pay rate is very decent. I wouldn't say the best, but very competitive. The plus to an average base pay is the opportunity for some amazing bonuses.The hours are standard, and AMC does seem to understand and push for a good work-life balance. The on-site staff at nearly every property I've visited has been extremely friendly and knowledgable. Working with AMC does not feel like working for a large corporation, where they address you by your employee number. Rather, it feels more like a family; we are brothers and sisters (our cousins if we're in different portfolios :) ). You get positive feed back, and constructive criticism from all levels of upper management, including the VP, President, and the owners of the respected property. Each level of the management tier truly does show their appreciation for their employees, and they do whatever they can to ensure everyone is happy in their position and with their career path. AMC has helped me find more than a job; they've help me create a positive and upwards-going career, and I will forever be grateful for the guidance, support, generosity, and career training they've provided myself and my staff. The overall benefits package is very so-so; 80/20 coverage, only one provider, no options, no 401k match, no company paid life insurance, no employee assistance. There also needs to be structure and written policy amongst the company to make transitioning from one property to another easier. Each community has it's own ways of doing things, there is no set policy, and you kind of make it up as you go, unless you have a great mentor who is willing to guide you (which in my case, I did!) Property staffing is normally limited, and 75-% your property will be short handed because another property needed coverage. Having access to credible temp workers, floaters, etc would help so much with basic efficiency at the property level. Provide options and better coverage levels for health insurance. Also provide more hands on training, employee education reimbursement for acquiring PM certification/accreditation, and give us our drop boxes back! Having more efficient accounting software that is more user friendly and adaptable to change would be great!

It is straight up commission and in addition to that, even if a sale is made, there is still a window of time where if the sale is canceled a short time after that you donÂ<U+0092>t get paid at all. That means all the hard work and walking and talking you do can go away just because a customer changed their mind.When I got the call from one of the admins to come in for an interview I asked Â<U+0093>is this a sales job? I want to make sure IÂ<U+0092>m making money.Â<U+0094> She said Â<U+0093>starting pay is $30,000Â<U+0094> That is if everything goes perfect and a sale is made every day. My advice, only take this job if sales is your thing and if this is something you deep down want to do. Otherwise, if you are looking for a steady pay job and really need to make money this is not for you. The only people really thriving are the ones at the top for as long as everyone underneath them are working hard and making sales they get paid no matter what, you are working for them!Yes you are trained and taught the Â<U+0093>8 great work habitsÂ<U+0094> but even if you do everything correctly there is no guarantee. A fun atmosphere they conduct in the office is not how you get paid but how many people you sign up in the field. I especially donÂ<U+0092>t like driving all over the place and not getting any compensation for it. Ultimately if you are looking for a job that will pay every week and are in it for the money then TURN BACK NOW.Side note, Dana and Darrell were the 2 of the 3 CEOs when I started there, and they were let go. What does that tell you? Office nights should be optional. I didnÂ<U+0092>t always have money on me to go out to the places chosen. After a hard days work in the field I just needed to go home and relax and eat for free!

Once they get procedures in place and feel they can have anyone else do the job, whether true or not, they lay off the original employees and replace them with people right out of college for 1/3 the wages. The people they hire out of college are not usually US citizens so they hire them for even less. They throw away people that know the job and the customer and are willing to work any hours to get the job done and keep the customer happy. They replace them with people that know nothing, do not care about the customer or their job since they are usually there just to get job experience and training. They create a revolving door of people supporting the customers. The customers become very upset. The quality of work goes down the drain and they eventually lose the contract of most of the servers they were supporting are taken back to support by the customer.

If you got a mid year promotion, you didn't get a pay raise until the end of the year, which was actually very disheartening. Compensation at the top level is not really known outside of the Directorship and it made it hard to know what the carrot was. There was a lot of speculation at the Associate level on salary increases and potential at the other levels, but people were very tight lipped about compensation overall.

Senior Management is very Rude12. The company saves money by asking the employees to join in India office and then they are usually assigned to Middle East projects (forever) with very poor daily allowance.

You get the benefits of a small company (ability to have an impact and influence company direction, accessible management) without the instability of bleeding edge startups that may go out of business anytime. REDACTED has an impressive customer list, including hundreds of the most prestigious medical groups and hospitals. I find employees I interact with to be experienced and hardworking, and willing to help out in areas of their expertise. I have worked at a huge consulting firm, and at a huge software development firm. I like the ability in a small firm to take on a high level of responsibility, develop a business area, see it to fruition, and then keep improving it.The pros of a small firm are you get to do everything. The cons of a small firm are you have to do everything. REDACTED doesnÂ<U+0092>t have huge support departments, so youÂ<U+0092>ll have one or two talented people helping you out but may need to do some legwork on your own. IÂ<U+0092>ve seen the management and infrastructure of REDACTED evolve over the past 10 years as the firm has grown. The challenge is keeping the Â<U+0091>right levelÂ<U+0092> of management and support departments to support the staff and fuel growth, without creating too much overhead. Mostly I think REDACTED has gotten it right. IÂ<U+0092>d encourage mentoring managerial skills in all the top performers, with some organizational professional development.

Management is terrible. All the departments managers hate each other. There is no cohesive team because all areas of the operation work independently.

There have been so many talented people who have left the company because the people that have the power are clueless. I don't expect this company to be in business for much longer. They have been in business since 1983 but the life cycle of the organization is showing to be on the decline. Choose your department heads wisely. The managers that you have chosen to be in a position of power are not providing you with accurate information.

The fact is, that there is an extremely high turnover and for a company that has been in business for 2- plus years, there is a surprising lack of real direction and firm processes. The processes and systems are always changing, IT does a horrible job of integrating operational demands into technological solutions. I fee like the only reason there is an IT department here is so that they can fix the absolutely absurd amount of system errors. The fact is, that this company is in serious danger of losing even its biggest clients. IN my tenure at REDACTEDMC, for every client we gained, we lost like 8 more. I seriously think we lost thirty clients while I was there and perhaps gained 5. I wouldn't be surprised if this place was out of business in 10 years.

You will make friends for life.Flexibility - IF you are a top performer, mgmt will bend over backwards to make you happy: including personal stuff (leave of absence or sabatical), and ability to influence what projects to work onStepping stone for great job at client - do well at your client and get hired by them...and skip ahead on the career ladder (relative to your friends who graduated with you and went to work directly for the client). Esp if you want to stay within the technology org for your client - the brand name typically carries respect.Travel / food - similar to other consulting firms, you will travel to interesting places and always eat very well. Also, work for the fun partners and you'll go on some legendary boondoggles. Work life balance can be pretty warped. Highest priority is delivery - your personal life will be sacrificed. Of course this varies by partner / team / client. I know several ppl who had a great work/life balance...but the higher up the ladder you go, this disappears pretty fast. Anyone at manager and above is going to be working their bu** off...at principal sleep can be optional.

1150,"- Ability to work with marquee clients (think large brand names, such as investment banks in Singapore- Pay structure on par with (touted to be better than) comparable positions across the Big-4, IF you are Caucasian or possess a degree from the more prestigious universities in the West- Occasional networking opportunities- Work-life balance in some projects- though this stems from the fact that most projects are technology delivery ones- Long 'bench' period for (permanent) employees not staffed on projects by any standards. Employees are known to have been paid salaries simply for reporting to work, while being unstaffed on any project, for as many as 13 months- Skewed foreigner-local employee ratio. This is a 'pro' considering that most IT talent originates from India; locals are relegated to admin/staff positions - The Asian office (Singapore/HK) is a glorified 'bodyshop'. Most projects do not come anywhere close to the definition of a 'consulting' engagement- As a result, most staff AKA 'consultants' are hired on the basis of their technical experience notwithstanding their deplorable people-management skills. Many come from no-name institutions across the West, which is justifiable in that more talented employees are likely to pass over this firm- Sub-optimal performance levels given that most employees are only in a limbo state awaiting their next gig- As with all tier-2/tier-3 consulting firms, unethical decisions are rife (and celebrated) so long as they translate to higher client revenue- Pay scales, by title/rank, are alleged to be wide. Expect to be paid at the lower end of the scale if you are not Caucasian- Inverted pyramid structure. Overcrowded at Principal/Senior Principal levels with few revenue streams. Unsustainable- The Singapore office thrives solely on a couple of projects in the financial services industry. Clients are able to see through the extent of value-addition promised vis-a-vis romantic expectations set and are scaling down their projects- Minimal opportunities for training and development- Advancement up the career ladder highly political and not meritocratic- The HR's capabilities do not seem to extend beyond hiring/firing candidates. It's no surprise that the firm exudes an image of a staffing firm vis-a-vis a consulting outfit To say that a lot of work is to be done would be an understatement.

They are infamous for hurting the small business owner by charging them a high up fee for 3 days of work by their analysts. However, once they send a consultant to the company they start racking up huge hourly fees that in reality have little to no benefit to the business. They harass the owners of the business until they get money out of them for bad business advice that they can't connect to any real savings or benefit to the business. If the business owner refuses to pay they will squat on the premises of the business and stalk the business owner until the business owner becomes so frustrated that they will put the charges on a credit card to get them off their property. As a sales person I realized that no matter how good I was at selling in the end I did not want to be involved with an organization such as this and their business practices. I also realized that it was a good old boys club that was more like a popularity contest and less like a performance based organization. If you don't kiss up you won't get good appointments. You will be sent to the Inside Sales Department and sent in circles to chase your tail. They will consider you an outcast if you start to complain based on your observations of reality.

These consultants have developed some of the most advanced solutions in health system strategy, and there is an immense wealth of experience in hospital/physician alignment and strategy. If you are committed to understanding the business dynamics of the healthcare industry, few places will provide such a focused and rich experience. Management just seems determined to drive young people out of the firm.Its almost as if they are deliberately trying to discourage young talent from contributing to the firm's success. A few things that they just don't seem to get:- Most of the work can be done remotely, yet they insist on office presence for the sake of it. Everyone is expected to work nights and weekends, proving that the work can be done anywhere, yet people have to be in seats at certain times of the day in low energy office locations. Many of these are often in undesirable and difficult to access parts of the metropolitan area.- Virtually no transparency is given to the criteria for promotion.- Staff consultants have no quarterly or even annual financial incentives to perform above and beyond expectations. Management seems to be content with a docile workforce that slogs along trying to avoid negative feedback and that is the extend of their incentive structure.- Social interaction and energy levels within the office are lacking tremendously. Management has expected this to occur organically through affinity group development where groups organize around specific interest areas, but management invests little to actively cultivate this.- Adoption of technology is excruciatingly slow. Office instant messaging was adopted just as that technology became obsolete. Can you imagine if they implemented something like Slack? Don't bet on it. Put some serious effort into financially rewarding performance at all levels and not just the senior manager level.Invest in leading edge communication technologies even if there is some potential risk involved.Catch up with the times on remote working arrangements, and stop discouraging or shaming individuals who are more productive when they are not shackled to a desk.","O415R"

Take better care of your people and listed to their concerns. When someone has been there a long time, give them severance when they are let go.

Management is excellent and has great communication with employees - I always felt like I knew what was going on in the business and what the strategic direction was for the firm. My biggest drawback is the lack of name recognition. This is something that REDACTED has been working on, but it can be very frustrating, both for selling work and for selling yourself (be it on a resume, with others, etc). For people who know the firm, REDACTED always has a stellar, shining reputation and people are impressed to hear that you work there. However, most will not know the firm. Secondly, project staffing can be somewhat subjective. It takes a good deal of internal politics to ensure you are staffed on the types of projects you want to work on.

1267,"-Work is well-done and impactful-Nice offices-Good benefits-Ability to work remotely or in the office I thought long and hard about writing this review, thinking the environment over the past six months was a phase, but the company culture and treatment of employees has continued to get worse.I feel most sorry for the staff consultants, who are pressured to write lengthy and time-consuming proposals and articles for senior managers and above, and who also must maintain full billable hours each week. These workhorses do not receive credit for their work, and in fact it is the senior employees who are rewarded for ""selling work"". After many of the support and marketing staff were let go earlier this year, this work was again shifted to the consultants who do not have any time dedicated in regular job duties to perform this work.Bad behavior from leadership continues for two reasons: this is how they were treated and managers are not compensated on their ability to successfully mentor and manage employees. Managers demand long work hours, rather than creating a more inclusive and balanced work environment, because that is how these legacy managers were treated as young careerists . Secondly, managers are mostly judged and promoted on selling work and are not meaningfully measured on their ability to be a good manager and mentor employees. Employees receive little management training, which shows in the dysfunctional team behavior. As another reviewer mentioned, the yearly retreat was loved by employees and was a great chance to network and create community within REDACTED. RIP. -Happy employees = creative, hardworking employees-Consider lowering the weekly billing requirement. You will be surprised what employees will come up with and sell when not tired, overworked, and stressed-Train all levels of employees to be high-performing and motivating managers. Build dedicated time into managements weekly job duties to mentor and manage their employees-Immediately message about firm changes before gossip gets out of control. Don't save this until all firm meetings (if it is even mentioned at all).","R149T"

The high turnover comes with a reason and those reasons have never been explored or questioned. Employee engagement and incentives are important so you should consider ideas on how to improve the company's name in that regard.

While the work was intersting, there wasn't much of it so there were a lot of slow days. But the worst part was my sudden termination. I was called into a meeting by my manager, who was not even in the office. I met with HR in a conference room and my manager let me go over the phone. No warnings were ever given prior to this meeting. I was never put on any sort of corrective action, and when asked, no specfic details were given as to the reason behind this decision, which tends to make me believe it wasn't his decision, but rather someone in upper management. This happened on a Monday, and I wasn't even allowed to finish the week. It was a huge slap in the face by people I was starting to trust. My warning for anyone considering working for this company, be prepared for your job to end any day without reason or notice, as this was what happened to me. Maybe this is something they will change, but right now, it left me extremely dissatisfied with this company. If you're planning on terminating someone's career, have the decency to let them know that their job is in jeopardy so that they have the chance to improve. And, if you ultimately reach the decision to end their career, be professional enough to do it in person, instead of waiting until you're out of the office so you can hide behind the phone. Also, letting them finish out the week, or waiting until a Friday might have been a nice thing to do as well.","B595V"

1336,"Decent benefits and interesting strategic projects As a former Kurt Salmon employee, I was skeptical when REDACTED acquired KS for several reasons: 1. REDACTEDÂ<U+0092>s lack of reputation/poor brand recognition in the market 2. Lower compensation/benefits packages. 3. Unclear strategic vision for the future of the firm. 4. Client work quality okay at best (all surface, no substance). However, I remained optimistic and stuck around to see how well the two firms would integrate. MISTAKE. It only took a short time to learn that (in addition to all of the above) REDACTEDÂ<U+0092>s overall culture and morale, lack of transparency from leadership, and treatment of their employees was disappointing at best.-Culture and morale: REDACTED has an outdated, office-based culture (Why do traveling consultants need offices in 2017?), resulting in largely empty offices with low morale. There is an unreasonable expectation that staff bill 100% of their time (85% billable work and 15% PTO) and billable hours/timesheets are micromanaged down to the second (e.g. Â<U+0093>I see that you have 4 hours free this week. To fill your time, please copy and paste your life away and bill it to a clientÂ<U+0094>). Consultants are often doing busy work that adds nothing to their professional development simply to fill up timesheets. This results in extremely overworked, poorly managed, burnt out, and undervalued staff.-Lack of transparency from leadership: Major decisions are being made at the top and employees are not notified until leadership cannot hide it anymore. For example, firing the entire marketing department, cancelling the summer internship program, and letting go 25-30 legacy KS employees (& several other REDACTED consultants) is something that has downstream implications to remaining employees. Yet, REDACTED leadership denied it as Â<U+0093>rumorsÂ<U+0094> and continues to do so not only in the press, but on Glassdoor (look at their responses to reviews). ItÂ<U+0092>s sad that leadership would rather protect their reputation as the Â<U+0093>best place to workÂ<U+0094> than be honest about whatÂ<U+0092>s actually happening. Judging by the major staff reductions coupled with their public claims of Â<U+0093>strong growth,Â<U+0094> it appears that leadership is positioning to sell the company.-Treatment of employees: Consultants are treated as workhorses, expected to make the firm look good or make money at every moment. Leadership appears cheap (cancellation of company retreats/consultant bootcamps) and solely profit-driven. Employees have been asked to share glowing reviews on public forums (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc) to beef up appearances. Consulting is a human capital business and the world of healthcare management consulting is small. Treat your employees poorly, and you will feel the results sooner or later. DonÂ<U+0092>t deny the honest, constructive feedback provided on forums like Glassdoor. Spend some time evaluating your business internally and being a little more self-aware.","M794R"

Very outdated resources in terms of technology and human capital. Staff and faculty are unionized which makes it very difficult to achieve goals due to politics and outdated ways of doing simple tasks, no one is held accountable (I literally watched a woman sleep at her desk and no one disciplined her due to her being employed at REDACTED for 35+ years and active in her Union), financial model of RCM is not efficient, wasteful spending due to lack of communication between colleges/schools and departments. Bring in consultants to assess resources and processes. REDACTED is the most inefficient place I've been employed in my career.","F566U"

1349,"The pay would have been decent, had they not fired me for a sick kid. I moved across the country for the position for Computer Specialist at ManCon. Two weeks after I started, I was fired because my daughter was sick. I lost tens of thousands of dollars, due to moving costs, and lost wages. I had been gainfully employed before accepting the position with ManCon, and left that position for this one. I am now living in a homeless shelter with my three children, because the management at this company has ZERO compassion.Additionally, during my time there, it was made clear that you are not allowed to take breaks, nor make or take personal phone calls during your break. I was followed into the break room and told that the cameras are used to track people throughout the day to ensure they're not taking breaks. Pretty creepy, to be honest. Don't ever hire someone from out of state again. Please. You literally destroyed my life. We have been homeless for about six months now, due to your lack of understanding or compassion. I moved my family across the country for this job, and you fired me with no remorse because my child was sick. That was incredibly heartless and cruel.","Y389E"

Small business to a fault, micromanagement, constantly changing management priorities, failure of management to listen to employee's (valid) concerns. Has seen ~50% staff turnover in the last 14 months, if that tells you something. Substandard benefits. Employees only valued by the amount of billable hours performed, not in skills, customers brought in, or satisfaction level of said customers. When there isn't enough work, you will receive the scorn, and the blame, and may be written up via email, which is completely unprofessional. Company sticks with ancient technology (hardware/software long beyond their expiration date), ignores employee recommendations until something catastrophic happens (and it does, and the business loses customers), then you better keep your mouth shut when you were proven right. Sell the company. The round-robin ""which employee should I pick on this month"" style of company leadership is a one-way ticket to the door for all, and explains the excessive turnover in recent months.","T159D"
