Subject: [R] Odd Results when generating predictions with nnet function
Message-ID: <CAMOcQfNKrAiXQs4yGDpPfjLQK1+ouJb0AhQ7X_x_-GRxLA6mLw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

Hope you are all doing well. I am currently using R version 4.0.2 and
working with the nnet package.

My dataframe consists of three columns, FECHA which is the date, x, which
is a sequence from 1 to 159, and y, which is the number of covid cases (I
am also providing the dput for this data frame below).

I tried fitting a neural net model using the following code:

xnew = 1:159
Fit <- nnet(a$y ~ a$x, a, size = 5, maxit = 1000, lineout = T, decay =
0.001)

Finally, I attempted to generate predictions with the following code:

predictions <- predict(Fit, newdata = list(x = xnew), type = "raw")

But obtained extremely odd results:
As you can see, instead of obtaining numbers, more or less in the range of
the last observations  of a$y, I end up getting a bunch of 1s, which
doesn?t make any sense (if anyone could help me understand what could be
causing this):
dput(predictions)

Subject: [R] Why does a 2 GB RData file exceed my 16GB memory limit when
 reading it in?
Message-ID: <CAJgUswJSO43GmChwySCSgXzmivWf85PkVeROgMhKRYsAM8SNuQ@mail.gmail.com>

I ran a number of analyses in R and saved the workspace, which
resulted in a 2GB .RData file. When I try to read the file back into R
later, it won't read into R and provides the error: "Error: cannot
allocate vector of size 37 Kb"

This error comes after 1 minute of trying to read things in - I
presume a single vector sends it over the memory limit. But,
memory.limit() shows that I have access to a full 16gb of ram on my
machine (12 GB are free when I try to load the RData file).

gc() shows the following after I receive this error:

used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb)
Ncells 623130 33.3 4134347 220.8 5715387 305.3
Vcells 1535682 11.8 883084810 6737.5 2100594002 16026.3

Subject: [R] Odd Results when generating predictions with nnet function

Generically, nnet(a$y ~ a$x, a ...) should be nnet(y ~ x, data=a, ...) otherwise predict will go looking for a$x, no matter what is in xnew. 

But more importantly, nnet() is a _classifier_, so the LHS should be a class, not a numeric variable.

Well, nnet() can be used for both classification *and* regression,
which is quite clear from the MASS book, but indeed, not from
its help page, which indeed mentions one formula  'class ~ ...'
and then only has classification examples.

So, indeed, the  ?nnet  help page could improved.

In his case, y are counts,  so  John Tukey's good old
"first aid transformation" principle would suggest to model

sqrt(y) ~ ..   in a *regression* model which nnet() can do.

Subject: [R] augPred and missing data error
Message-ID: <72e84da8b5374afdaebe55ed4e637ab0@SRVEXCHCM1302.precheza.cz>

Dear all

I would like to ask if augPred is able to handle missing values. Here is
example with below data "test".  I read augPred documentation and nothing is
mentioned that fitted object from data with missing values cannot be used in
augPred. Maybe it would be worth to add something.

Or I just did not read it correctly and with some special setting augPred
can handle such objects?

Cheers
Petr Pikal

test data below

test.g <- groupedData(vodivnorm~cas|variable, data=test)
fit <- nlsList(vodivnorm ~ SSbiexp(cas, Al, lrc1, A2, lrc2), data=test.g)
Error in na.fail.default(data) : missing values in object

na.exclude (or na.omit) works as expected

fit <- nlsList(vodivnorm ~ SSbiexp(cas, Al, lrc1, A2, lrc2), data=test.g,
na.action=na.exclude)

However augPred results in error
plot(augPred(fit))
Error in tapply(object[[nm]], groups, FUN[["numeric"]], ...) : 
  arguments must have same length

The workaround is to discard missing values **before** the fit.

test.gs <- test.g[complete.cases(test.g),]
fit <- nlsList(vodivnorm ~ SSbiexp(cas, Al, lrc1, A2, lrc2), data=test.gs)
plot(augPred(fit))

Compressed in RData but uncompressed in main memory....

But the data may need more....

So 16GB were used when R gave up.

Dear Dr. Martin and Dr. Peter,

Hope you are doing well. Thank you for your kind feedback. I also tried
fitting the nnet using y ~ x, but the model kept on generating odd
predictions. If I understand correctly, from what Dr. Martin said, it would
be a good idea to try modeling sqrt(y) ~ x and then backtransform raising
both y and x to 0.5?

I was looking at a video where the guy modeled count data without doing any
kind of transformation and didn't get odd results, which is rather extrange.

Cheers,

Paul

Why would you expect raising y_pred to the 0.5 to "backtransform" a model sqrt(y)~x? Wouldn't you raise to the 2?

Why would you "backtransform" x in such a model if it were never transformed in the first place? Dr Maechler did not suggest that.

And why are you mentioning some random unspecified video on Youtube? That does not enlighten anyone here, apparently including you. Please reference package documentation, and/or reproduce the analysis discussed in that video to provide a contrasting (or supporting) point with the example you gave.

The problem seems to be the fit rather than the predictions. Looks like nnet is happier with data between 0 and 1, witness

Fit <- nnet(y/max(y) ~ x, a, size = 5, maxit = 1000, lineout = T, decay = 0.001)
plot(y/max(y)~x,a)
lines(fitted(Fit)~x,a)

Subject: [R] Odd Results when generating predictions with nnet function

You are right Jeff, that was a mistake, I was focusing on the square root
and made the mistake of talking about taking the square root instead of
raising to the 2nd power.

This is the example I was following (
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQgA6V8UA4). Of course, I tried fitting
the nnet model to my own data, to see what kind of results I'd get (the
data that I used, I provided in the very first e-mail).

The question I was asking is why do I get a bunch of 1s for the
predictions, given that the expected results would have to be somewhere
close to the latest observations.

The code and the data from the example I was following is provided in the
youtube link above.

For my own part, looking at the OP's question, it does seem curious
that R could write that .RData file, but on the same system not be able
to reload something it created.  How would that work.  Wouldn't the
memory limit have been exceeded BEFORE the the .RData file was written
the FIRST time?

R experts may give you a detailed explanation, but it is certainly possible
that the memory available to R when it wrote the file was different than
when it tried to read it, is it not?

Thank you Uwe, John, and Bert - this is very helpful context.

If it helps inform the discussion, to address John and Bert's
questions - I actually had less memory free when I originally ran the
analyses and saved the workspace, than when I read in the data back in
later on (I rebooted in an attempt to free all possible memory before
rereading the workspace back in).

David,

If the ".Rdata" contains more than one object you could (and maybe should
use) the SOAR package (from Venables). This package helps you to split the
objects over multiple RData files. It's useful when you have numerous
medium-large objects in the workspace but doesn't use then at the same
time.

When use SOAR::Attach(), for instance, it loads the current name of all the
objects and retain than available in the searchpath but without load then
to the memory. As you call, they will be loaded into the memory.

If needed, you can update the object and then store it again with the
SOAR::Store()

For my use, this package is terrific! I use it with an analysis that I need
to repeat over medium-large similars datasets.

Best

You need more RAM to load this file. As the memory was being used in your original file, certain objects (such as numeric columns) were being shared among different higher-level objects (such as data frames). When serialized into the file those optimizations were lost, and now those columns are stored separately.

Search [1] for "shared" to learn more about measuring object memory requirements.

GDAL supports GRIB2 so it should be easy using rgdal and raster packages.

A very simple search (= "CRAN NOAA .grb2") and small bit of reading help 
files suggests that you might want wgrib2 and rNOMADS

I assumed that, though I shouldn't have.  Nice to know.  Were you
working from a terminal or through a GUI like RStudio?  You will need
to provide a really clear description of the initial and later
conditions.  Your step to reboot and then load is exactly what I would
have done, I would also have killed any network connection temporarily
to see if there are other things going on that caused the problem out
side of R.  You should also let any potential helper know what OS you
are using, and what hardware configuration you have.  Since you
rebooted you are probably not working across a network, but ...

Hi Hesham,
It think you are looking for something like this:

truth<-data.frame(G1=sample(LETTERS[1:4],20,TRUE),
 G2=sample(LETTERS[1:4],20,TRUE))
truth
truth$G3<-as.numeric(truth$G1 == truth$G2)
truth

Note that like quite a few emails produced with Javascript formatting,
there are embedded characters that R can't interpret.

so as.data.frame unnecessary

better str(geneExp) to see actual structure

My guess is that during fiddling with as.data.frame and matrix your data are
not complient with the function

"a SummarizedExperiment, data frame or matrix for condition 1, with gene IDs
as rownames and sample IDs as column names"

No (or almost no) attachments allowed. Better using dput for sharing data.

The qs package might also be worth a try. I don't have a specific
reason for thinking it will avoid the original problem, but in general
qs uses lots of fancy compression and memory management features.

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] new ivreg package for 2SLS regression with diagnostics
Message-ID: <febda047-9c87-840b-d995-41e58d116021@mcmaster.ca>

Dear list members,

Christian Kleiber, Achim Zeileis, and I would like to announce a new 
CRAN package, ivreg, which provides a comprehensive implementation of 
instrumental variables estimation using two-stage least-squares (2SLS) 
regression.

The standard regression functionality (parameter estimation, inference, 
robust covariances, predictions, etc.) in the package is derived from 
and supersedes the ivreg() function in the AER package. Additionally, 
various regression diagnostics are supported, including hat values, 
deletion diagnostics such as studentized residuals and Cook's distances; 
graphical diagnostics such as component-plus-residual plots and 
added-variable plots; and effect plots with partial residuals. In order 
to provide these features, the ivreg package integrates seamlessly with 
other packages through suitable S3 methods, specifically for generic 
functions in the base-R stats package, and in the car, effects, lmtest, 
and sandwich packages, among others.

The ivreg package is accompanied by two online vignettes: a brief 
general introduction to the package, and an introduction to the 
regression diagnostics and graphics that are provided.

For more information, see the ivreg CRAN webpage at 
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=ivreg> and the ivreg pkgdown webpage 
at <https://john-d-fox.github.io/ivreg/>.

Comments, suggestions, and bug reports would be appreciated.

John

Subject: [R] Assigning cores
Message-ID: <CAA0F9kWW+SwB_ZZGop+gWHZRgv4BN4KMN8Kzpu+5DE-5=LnxNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm working on a large simulation and I'm using the doParallel package to
parallelize my work. I have 20 cores on my machine and would like to
preserve some for day-to-day activities - word processing, sending emails,
etc.

I started by saving 1 core and it was clear that *everything* was so slow
as to be nearly unusable.

Any suggestions on how many cores to hold back (e.g., not to put to work on
the parallel process)?

Thanks,
Leslie

Hi Leslie and all.

You may want to investigate using SparklyR on a cloud environment like  
AWS, where you have more packages that are designed to work on cluster  
computing environments and you have more control over those types of  
parallel operations.


V/r,

Tom W.

Hi all,



I have 71 raster for each year. I am trying to convert all raster layer to 1 array (94 ,192 , 71) and then ? would calculate for each word cell a linear regression that shows the change but i dont know how ? can do this


For creating array with rasters between 1949 and 2019

library(raster)
r<-raster("C:/max_consecutive_days_1949.tif")
a<-array(NA,dim=c(dim(r)[1:2],71))
i <- 1
for (year in 1949:2019) {
  fi<-paste0("C:/ max_consecutive_days_",year,".tif")
  r<-raster(fi)
  a[,,i]<-getValues(r,format="matrix")
            i<-i+1
}

Do you have 20 actual cores or 10 cores/20 threads? detectCores() doesn't usually know the difference but the CPU may be too busy accessing memory to let that last thread get any useful work done. I often find that allocating real cores is more practical than thinking in terms of thread so try allocating 9 workers and watch your cpu usage.

Experiment with your settings... the right balance may be dependent on your other activities as well as your hardware, since your analysis may not be completely memory access limited and threads might make (some) sense for you.

Dear Leslie,

you can also use the core parallel 
package.  See ?parallel::makeCluster and 
?parallel::parSapply.

Here I run the function FUN on the 
vector 1:3 over three threads.  FUN 
needs otherFun, so you can export it to 
the cluster.  Remember to stop the 
cluster in the end.

	cl <- parallel::makeCluster(3)
	FUN <- function(x) {
	  return(otherFun(x^2))
	}
	otherFun <- function(x) {
	  return(x+1)
	}
	parallel::clusterExport(cl, "otherFun")
	parallel::parSapply(
	  cl=cl,
	  X=1:3,
	  FUN=FUN)
	parallel::stopCluster(cl)

You could run e.g. 15 cores or 
something?  parallel::makeCluster(15) 
...

Best,
Rasmus

The big question is whether each worker or thread uses parallel
processing itself, or whether it uses resources like cache in which
case 20 threads fighting over the cache would slow you down
substantially. If your simulations use operations implemented in BLAS
or LAPACK, be aware that some R installations use custom fast BLAS
that can use multiple cores and the processor cache. You can see some
of it in sessionInfo().

The other issue is memory usage - if you exhaust your physical RAM,
your computer will slow down not so much because of CPU load but
rather because of memory management (swapping to and from disk).

I would run some smaller experimental runs that take just a minute or
two to finish with say 4, 8 and 12 workers and see how fast these go -
you may find no or very little speed up past 8 or perhaps even 4-6
workers.

HTH,

Peter

Hi Ahmet,
I really can't work out what your problem is. I don't have access to
the data you are using and so cannot inspect "a" to see what might be
in it.

Hello,

I made a mistake today on simple counting in R, that almost got me into trouble. After trying multiple times, I finally figured out it's rounding issue in R.

For exmaple, when I just simply type:

> (6.9-6.3) > 0.6
[1] TRUE

6.9-6.3 should be 0.6 exactly, but R thinks that it's greater than 0.6!!

Similarly, R thinks 5.6-5.5 is smaller than 0.1:

> (5.6-5.5) < 0.1
[1] TRUE

Why is the above happening? This rounding issue seems to be small, but this could cause serious problem in real world.

Can anyone shed a light on how to avoid the issue?

Thanks,

Yi

Maybe learn a little bit about digital arithmetic?

Indeed.

In addition:  Do *not* use  suppressWarnings( . ) lightly !

Warnings are there for a good reason, and you should think hard
and may be ask for help before "blindly" using
suppressWarnings().

Whoever told you to do that routinely
has not been a good teacher of R ..

Greetings,

I am a brand-new user to R and want to install and run this on my iMac running macOS 10.15.6.  I successfully downloaded the correct package, installed it with no problems (I was not given any options for Tcl/Tk or Texinfo), and started it up as any other normal app.  Some introductory commands like license() and help() worked just fine.  But when I went to execute demo(), it just beach-balled.  I?ve had to force-quit R a number of times.

Yes, I read the Mac installation instructions.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Sounds like you need to install XQuartz:

  https://www.xquartz.org

which is referenced in the macOS installation instructions and the macOS specific FAQ.

Also, be aware that there is a macOS specific e-mail list here:

  https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mac

which is where macOS specific R issues should be posted.

You will need to re-install XQuartz any time you upgrade/install a new version of R.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R] Survival Object - is 12month survival = 365days
Message-ID: <ff0a24c9-c000-4e6d-9dd9-ecfd2dac13be@nhs.net>

Using survfit I can get the '1 year' Survival from this dataset which holds survival in days:

require (survival)
survfit( Surv(time, status) ~sex, data=colon)
summary (fit, 365)

My current real world data I'm calculating time using lubridate to calculate time and since it made the axis easy I just told it to do and so my "time" appears to be  a float in months.

time <- time_length(interval(startDate, endDate), "months")

Is there a "right" approach to this (as in a convention). If I use 12months as a year and describe it in the write up as 12, 24 and 36 month survival rather than 1, 2 and 3 year presumably that is OK..

I've been asked to report 30, 60 & 90day. Then 6month, 1, 2 and 3 year survival.

Should I calculate time 3 times, (interval day, month and year) and run the survival on each to get the requested outputs or would people just provide something close.

Should I run a campaign to decimilise time?

Hi Mike,

The installation interface has a minimal process, where what may be optional components are left to you to install on your own. Thus, the Installation and Admin manual references these, as does the macOS FAQ, but the wording may leave open to interpretation what may or may not be required, based upon your specific use case. In some use cases, XQuartz would not be required and you need to go to a third party site to obtain it, much like you would need to for MacTeX or similar.

With respect to the lists, each R list is moderated by a volunteer, thus will require a subscription in order to get your posts sent out without manual intervention by the list admins/moderators. For example, I am one of the two Admins for R-Devel, along with Martin M?chler, thus spend some amount of time having to manually approve posts where the poster is not, and does not become a subscriber.

Once you subscribe, and your first post is approved, subsequent posts can get through without manual intervention, which is appreciated.

If you do not want to keep getting posts from the lists, once your issue is resolved, you can return to the list interface, sign into your account, and disable getting the posts. Of course, if you need to interact again in the future, you would need to remember to re-enable the posts being sent, as responses to posts do not always include you as a cc:.

Digests are available, but can be more complicated to interact with, in some cases, depending upon your e-mail client, if you should want to reply to a specific post. You can set this in your account settings for the relevant list if you wish.

One option for you to consider, is that I have server side filters/rules set up for the R lists (and others) that I subscribe to. These then move each e-mail from my main inbox to the relevant online (IMAP) sub-folder for organization. Thus, it keeps my inbox clean and let's me review relevant posts in a more efficient and focused manner.

Regards,

Marc

Hi,

The answer may depend upon whether you are presenting the results in a tabular fashion, in the body of a manuscript, or in a figure. Also, what may be the community conventions in your domain. 

If you want to get the irregular time points out in a single output, you can use the times argument to do this, remembering that the default time intervals are in days for this dataset:

> summary(fit, times = c(30, 60, 90, 180, 365.25, 2 * 365.25, 3 * 365.25))
Call: survfit(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = colon)

                sex=0 
 time n.risk n.event survival std.err lower 95% CI upper 95% CI

Now, the time output there is arguably a bit cumbersome to read...but, at least you get the relevant values in a single output. You can transform those values as you may require.

Another option is to use the scale argument, but I just noted that, unless I am missing something, I think that there may be a lingering buglet in the code for summary.survfit(), and I am adding Terry Therneau here as a cc:, if that is correct. The behavior of the interaction between the times and scale arguments changed in 2009 after an exchange I had with Thomas Lumley: 

  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2009-April/052901.html

and it is not clear to me if the current behavior is or is not intended after all this time. Albeit, it may be the defacto behavior at this point in either case, given some volume of code written over the years that may depend upon this behavior.

Thus, this may be better for you, using the current behavior:

> summary(fit, scale = 30.44, times = c(1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36) * 30.44)
Call: survfit(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = colon)

where the times values are now in months over the range of values, instead of days.

I don't use the lubridate package, so there may be other options for you there, but the above will work, if your underlying time intervals in the source data frame for the model are still in days as a unit of measurement. 

Using the base graphics functions, albeit perhaps you are using ggplot or similar, you can plot the above model with axis markings at the irregular time intervals, using something like the following:

plot(fit, xaxt = "n", las = 1, xlim = c(0, 36 * 30.44))
axis(1, at = c(1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36) * 30.44, labels = c(1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36), cex.axis = 0.65)

This essentially truncates the x axis to 36 months, since the intervals in the example colon dataset go to about 9 years or so, and does not label the x axis. Bearing in mind that the underlying x axis unit is in days, the axis() function then places labels at the irregular intervals. You could then annotate the plot further as you may desire.

Marc Schwartz

Hi Mark

Huge thanks for the detailed answer.

At the moment, likely to be a mix of tabulation (30, 60, 90), a plot and some narrative with the 6mo, 12mo and so on. I think!

So it sounds like days is the answer, and then estimate months and years from days.

Hi,

The answer may depend upon whether you are presenting the results in a tabular fashion, in the body of a manuscript, or in a figure. Also, what may be the community conventions in your domain.

If you want to get the irregular time points out in a single output, you can use the times argument to do this, remembering that the default time intervals are in days for this dataset:

> summary(fit, times = c(30, 60, 90, 180, 365.25, 2 * 365.25, 3 * 365.25))
Call: survfit(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = colon)

Good morning Marc,

Thank you kindly for your quick response.  I had read prior to installation
that I might have needed or wanted to install some different packages to
support R, but did not catch that XQuartz was a requirement.  (I also never
got prompted for various options during the installation of R-4.0.2.pkg.)

Regarding email lists, perhaps you can assist with this question: While I
don't mind becoming a registered member, I prefer not to get email traffic
from groups as I have in the past (I actually really hate email for a lot
of reasons these days), so I'm wondering, is there a way to get a digest (I
thought I saw that) of just a weekly summary of information or questions
posted, rather than getting CC:d on every back-and-forth within the user
community?  Also, do I have to become an approved user to the R mailing
list community or anything like that?  Or are all posts moderated?

Now that the weekend is upon me, I'll have some time to come up to speed on
all this.  Thanks for your patience.

Thanks again!
Mike

Philip,

And how much available memory do you have on that host?

Hi Philip:

It would help if you gave the complete script you are trying to run,  and the name of the file.  

for those unfamiliar with all this,  Philip has already downloaded the grib2 file,  either using rNOMADS or directly from the NOAA website,  and the function he is calling reads the data from that grib2 file by wrapping a system call to a C-program called wgrib2.  And if you don't know about grib2 files,  they are highly compressed files of fields,  using bit-packing to do the compression. Forecast grib2 files usually have a plethora of fields,  for example since I don't know exactly which  NOAA Rapid Refresh model files he obtain,  looking at the inventory of one possible such file,  see:

https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/rap/rap.t00z.awp252pgrbf00.grib2.shtml

Usually given this,  only one or a couple of fields at a time are unpacked,  unless you have a large computer.  Since no example script was given,  it is impossible to tell if he is trying to read in the entire grib2 file or what.  And each expanded array in R will be much much bigger than the equivalent in grib2.

Subject: [R] fusion of two matrices (numerical and logical)
Message-ID: <CAHLp6SAWgxJvBJdXb03ZU-XaTxp+NUO31oB=iO2X7j=y4oNcbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
I would like to get help in combining two matrices. Here is my example:
A <- 1:20
B <- matrix(A,nrow=5,ncol=4)
# B is a numerical matrix
C <- B<7
C[4,4] <- TRUE
# C is a logical matrix
# if I combine A and C, I get a vector
D1 <- A[C==TRUE]
D1
D2 <- A[C==FALSE]
D2

I want to get a matrix with the same dimensions as matrix A. At the
coordinates given by the vector D1, I want to retain the values in
matrix A. At the locations in D2, I want a zero value.
I want to know if I can do this without using any loops.
Thanks, Vivek

The result that I want to get is this:

  for (j in 1:4) {
    B[i,j] <- ifelse(C[i,j]==FALSE,0,B[i,j])
  }
}
I would like to know if I can do this without loops.

A is not a matrix. I presume you meant B. If so:

> B[!C] <- 0
> B
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    6    0    0
[2,]    2    0    0    0
[3,]    3    0    0    0
[4,]    4    0    0   19
[5,]    5    0    0    0

Cheers,
Bert

Subject: [R] dataRetrieval query error
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.20.2009051634360.25030@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

I'm learning the dataRetrieval package. Following the example in Section
1.1.2 of the vignette (whatNWISdata) I prepared this script:
------
library("dataRetrieval")

siteNumbers <- c("14207920","14208000","14208200","14208300","14208500","14208600","14208700","14208850","14209000","14209100","14209250","14209500","14209600","14209670","14209700","14209710","14209750","14209775","14209790","14209900","14210000","14210005","14210020","14210025","14210030","14210100","14210150","14210152","14210160","14210200","14210255","14210400","14210480","14210490","14210500","14210530","14210535","14210600","14210650","14210676","14210750","14210760","14210765","14210800","14210830","14210850","14210900","14211000","14211004","14211005","14211006","14211008","14211010","14211023","14211494")

dataAvailable <- whatNWISdata(siteNumbers, service="all", parameterCD="all", statCD="all")
-----

The vignette says that for service, parameterCD, and statCD the default is
"all", but the package wants that explicitly. So that's what I did. Yet, my
syntax is still off:

> source("R-scripts/get-site-data-list.R") 
Error: All components of query must be named

Please show me what I'm missing.

You failed to name the first parameter, siteNumbers?

Name all your arguments (the vignette gets this wrong), including
siteNumber=siteNumbers.

Also, the vignette uses 'statCd', not 'statCD'.

dataAvailable <- whatNWISdata(siteNumber=siteNumbers, service="all",
statCd="all")

gives some results.

I am afraid this is completely unreadable because you posted in HTML ad 
this is a plain text list. Best to resend it having set your mailer to 
send plain text as HTML gets mangled here.

This is where I defined that vector; the MUA split it into two lines. The
vector's name is the same as in the vignette example

>> dataAvailable <- whatNWISdata(siteNumbers, service="all", parameterCD="all", statCD="all")

Have I not specified the list of site numbers properly here?

Thanks,

Rich

David/Bert,

Mea culpa! The vignette example used a single siteNumber which is also the
variable name and I missed that last point.

Thank you very much.

The dataRetrieval package PDF has a list of values returned by
whatNWISdata(). One value returned when I run this function is not on the
list and my searches of USGS web sites doesn't find it. The value's name is
"ts_id". A pointer to where that's defined is needed.

Hi

You still fail to send your message in plain text, so it is unreadable.

If I managed to decipher it correctly what you wanted you probably could set 2 
related logical expression and considering that FALSE is 0 and TRUE is 1 you 
get desired result.

Cheers
Petr

Almost surely.  With R, all things are possible. :-)

To Luigi;


Citing a 50 year-old paper that sits behind a paywall seems a bit 
ineffective in getting coding support.

Seems this might be a more appropriate question on the R-SIG-ecology or 
R-SIG-phylo mailing lists. (It would also have been appropriate to 
indicate what sort of searching has been done. My efforts at searching 
led me to the vegan package and this tutorial: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vignettes/diversity-vegan.pdf 
. It doesn't appear to have a Hutcheson t-test, but I'm guessing that is 
because there are more modern and more sophisticated tests currently in 
use.)

I cited that paper to show what test I was referring to, I was hoping it
was already coded...
Thanks, I will look into vegan

RE: Some R code works on Linux, but not Linux via Windows Subsystem Linux

This is taking data from a CSV and placing it into a data frame.  This is R
3.6.3 inside Windows Subsystem for Linux v2, Ubuntu 18.04.   The exact same
code, unchanged and on the same computer, works correctly in Ubuntu 18.04
and other Linux systems directly if the computer is dual booted into one of
those rather than Windows.

    Error in FUN(X[[i]], ?) :
      only defined on a data frame with all numeric variables
    Calls: Summary.data.frame -> lapply -> FUN

Any idea why the FUN function would error on Windows Subsytem for Linux,
but not Linux itself?  Any insight into the basic mechanism of how that
could vary between systems?  Haven't yet checked to see if the data is even
getting imported via WSL.  The script runs using Rscript as opposed to
running interactively via the R console.

Hi Robert,
You don't provide a self-contained reproducible example, so I am just
guessing here.
I doubt your theory that the error is related to R. More likely the step
that creates a data frame from reading
the CSV is probably resulting in different data frames in the two cases. I
recommend that you compare the
data frames. (And, if they differ, it might be related to filenames,
directory structures, assumptions about these, etc.)
Another possibility is that you have R 4.* somewhere and there is, in fact,
a difference between R 3.* and R4.*
in terms of creating a data frame from a CSV file.

If my "guesses" are not correct, see if you can create a self-contained
reproducible example
(that does not depend on reading in the CSV. You can just provide the
contents of the data frame via dput().)
Then post the example to the list.

HTH,
Eric

Yes, I think you should just try importing the data (reading the CSV), 
this is probably where things break. Then try also with a small trivial 
variant of that CSV, ensuring it only has ASCII characters, as a sanity 
check. So in other words, creating a minimal reproducible example. This 
can be an encoding issue, for instance.

Could it be that the test you are looking for is implemented in the 
vegan package (function diversity(... index = "shannon" ...), and/or the 
BiodiversityR package, function "diversityresult (..., index = 
"Shannon",...)

Message-ID: <CAN9eD7=-gO1xa9-vqenOjNJMzRCfDJEuAM53PtUrhE4aEoyGmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to get columns out of a filematrix using the column name
directly in the same way that  you can with a regular matrix?

library(filematrix)
M<-t(matrix(1:3,3,4))
colnames(M)<-c("one","two", "three")
M
#Extract column
M[,1]
M[,"one"]
M[,c(1,3)]
M[,c("one","three")]
FM<-fm.create.from.matrix(filenamebase = "test",mat = M)
FM[,1]
colnames(FM)
#extract by column by name does not work
FM[,"one"]

#workaround using grep
#is there a more direct way of doing this  to retrieve more than one column?
FM[,grep("one",colnames(FM))]

FM[,c(grep("one",colnames(FM)),grep("three",colnames(FM)))]

many thanks for any suggestions

Hello,

No, it's not. That's the Shannon diversity index, the test the OP is 
looking for is a t-test for Shannon diversity index equality. The index 
itself is easy to code. A very simple example, based on ?vegan::diversity:


library(vegan)

data(BCI)
H <- diversity(BCI[1,])    # just first row

divers <- function(n){
   p <- n/sum(n)
   log_p <- numeric(length(n))
   log_p[n != 0] <- log(p[n != 0])
   -sum(p * log_p)
}
HRui <- divers(BCI[1,])

identical(H, HRui)
#[1] TRUE


The vegan function is more general, it applies this and other indices 
calculations to a matrix or array.

The t-test doesn't seem difficult to code.
The variance formula in the paper and in the OP's posted link [1] are 
not the same, the original has one more term, but the degrees of freedom 
formula are the same. It all seems straightforward coding.

Luigi: Maybe later today I will have time but I am not making promises.

Maybe the following is a solution:

# load package needed
# QSutils is on Bioconductor
library(QSutils)

# here some exemplary data - these are the data from Pilou 1966 that are 
used
# in the second example of Hutcheson, J theor Biol 129:151-154 (1970)

earlier <- c(0,0,146,0,5,46,0,1,295,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0)
later <- c(0,0,142,0,5,46,0,1,246,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0)

# here starts the code ; you may replace the variables "earlier" and "later"
# by your own numbers.

# calculate h, var(h) etc
h1 <- Shannon(earlier)
varh1 <- ShannonVar(earlier)
n1 <- sum (earlier)
h2 <- Shannon(later)
varh2 <- ShannonVar(later)
n2 <- sum (later)
degfree <- (varh1 + varh2)**2 /(varh1**2/n1 + varh2**2 /n2)

# compare numbers with those in the paper
h1
h2
varh1
varh2

Here var(h) is calculated as in ref 1 cited by Rui Barradas - I guess 
that explains the minor numerical differences obtained with the code 
above and the published variances.

# this is the actual t-test
t <- (h1-h2) /sqrt(varh1 + varh2)
p <- 2*pt(-abs(t),df= degfree)
p

that's it
Best
Karl

Hi Nevil,
As I don't have the filematrix package this is really an "any suggestion":

FM[,which(colnames(FM) %in% c("one","three"))]

Subject: [R] calculating a linear regression for each grid cell. firstly
Message-ID: <VI1PR0302MB3199F2DEB96EDFB0B65238C3BB260@VI1PR0302MB3199.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

       Hi all,


            for example, ? have 4 raster data and ? try to convert these rasters to 1 array and calculate a linear regression for each grid cell how can ? do this?



                max_consecutive_days_1<- raster(ncol=94, nrow=192, xmn=-180, xmx=180, ymn=-90, ymx=90)
                max_consecutive_days_2<- raster(ncol=94, nrow=192, xmn=-180, xmx=180, ymn=-90, ymx=90)
                max_consecutive_days_3<- raster(ncol=94, nrow=192, xmn=-180, xmx=180, ymn=-90, ymx=90)
                max_consecutive_days_4<- raster(ncol=94, nrow=192, xmn=-180, xmx=180, ymn=-90, ymx=90)

                values(max_consecutive_days_1)  <- 1:ncell(max_consecutive_days_1)
                values(max_consecutive_days_2) <- 1:ncell(max_consecutive_days_2)
                values(max_consecutive_days_3) <- 1:ncell(max_consecutive_days_3)
                values(max_consecutive_days_4) <- 1:ncell(max_consecutive_days_4)
                set.seed(0)
                values(max_consecutive_days_1)  <- runif(ncell(max_consecutive_days_1))
                values(max_consecutive_days_2) <- runif(ncell(max_consecutive_days_2))
                values(max_consecutive_days_3) <- runif(ncell(max_consecutive_days_3))
                values(max_consecutive_days_4) <- runif(ncell(max_consecutive_days_4))

         I tried to convert raster to an array and calculate a linear regression for each cell with these codes. there is something wrong in codes but I didn't find what it's wrong

        library(raster)
            r<-raster("C:/max_consecutive_days_1.tif")
            a<-array(NA,dim=c(dim(r)[1:2],4))
            i <- 1
            dir.in <- "C:/max_consecutive_days/"
            for (year in 1:4) {
              fi<-paste0(dir.in,"max_consecutive_days_",year,".tif")
              r<-raster(fi)
              a[,,i]<-getValues(r,format="matrix")
              i<-i+1
            }


     lmfunction <- function(x){

              if (is.na(x[1])){ NA }

              else

                y<-c(1:length(x))
              m1<- summary(lm(x~y))
              coef <- m1$coef[2]

              coef
             }

            storem <- array(NA,dim=dim(a)[1:2])
            for(i in 1:94){
              for(j in 1:192){
                tst<-mean(a[i,j,],n.rm=T)
                if (is.na(tst)==F){
                  storem[i,j]<-lmfunction(a[i,j,])
                }
              }
            }

Subject: [R] facet_wrap(nrow) ignored
Message-ID: <2e8ae7a0-d752-8053-937b-607dc96da766@rgzm.de>

Dear useRs,

I have an issue with the argument nrow of ggplot2::facet_wrap().

Let's consider some sample data:
mydf <- data.frame(grp = rep(letters[1:6], each = 15), cat = rep(1:3,
30), var = rnorm(90))

And let's try to plot with 5 rows:
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mydf, aes(x = cat, y = var)) + geom_point() +
facet_wrap(~grp, nrow = 5)
It plots 2 rows and 3 columns rather than 5 rows and 2 columns as wanted.

These plots are as expected:
ggplot(data = mydf, aes(x = cat, y = var)) + geom_point() +
facet_wrap(~grp, nrow = 2)
ggplot(data = mydf, aes(x = cat, y = var)) + geom_point() +
facet_wrap(~grp, nrow = 6)

My guess is that 5 rows is not ideal for 6 facets (5 facets in 1st
column and only 1 facet for 2nd column) so it overrides the value of
nrow. In the case of 2 or 6 rows, the facets are well distributed in the
layout.

The reason why I need 5 rows with 6 facets is that this facet plot is
part of a patchwork and I would like to have the same number of rows for
all facet plots of the patchwork (so that they all align well).

Is there a way to force the number of rows in the facet_wrap()?

Thank you in advance.
Best,
Ivan

Thank you very much for the code, that was very helpful.
I got the article by Hutcheson -- I don't know if I can distribute it
, given the possible copyrights, or if I can attach it here -- but it
does not report numbers directly: it refers to a previous article
counting bird death on a telegraph each year. The numbers
are:
bird_1956 <- c(4,4,190,135,56,3,2,2,1,12,41,201,1,0,131,3)
bird_1957 <- c(4,111,53,66,146,222,126,61,0,2323,21)
bird_1958 <- c(0,3,32,228,56,102,0,11,2,220,0)
bird_1959 <- c(0,0,14,59,26,68,0)
bird_1960 <- c(0,0,73,66,71,25,0,109,63,1)

This for sake of the argument.
As for my problem, I implemented the Shannon index with the package
iNext, which only gives me the index itself and the 95% CI. Even when
I implemented it with vegan, I only got the index. Essentially I don't
have a count of species I could feed into the Hutcheson's. Is there a
way to extract these data? Or to run a Hutcheson's on the final index?
Thank you

Update:
I can see that you used the function Shannon from the package QSutils.
This would supplement the iNext package I used and solve the problem.
Thank you.

Dear Ivan,

I don't think it is possible to force a number of rows - but I'm 
honestly just guessing.

What you can do is to add an empty plot. Here I use cowplot, but 
gridExtra should also work well.

I add an indication of the row number for the plot to the initial 
data.frame, and loop over these.

In the first variant, I add an unused factor to the grp which creates an 
empty facet. I personally think this looks a little confusing, so in the 
second variant, I add a number of empty plots.

HTH
Ulrik

```
mydf <- data.frame(
   grp = rep(letters[1:6], each = 15),
   cat = rep(1:3, 30),
   var = rnorm(90),
   row_num = rep(c(1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), each = 15)
)

s_mydf <- split(mydf, mydf$row_num)

plots_mydf <- lapply(s_mydf, function(x){
   # Ensure no unused factors
   x$grp <- droplevels.factor(x$grp)
   if(length(unique(x$grp)) == 1){
     x$grp <- factor(x$grp, levels = c(unique(x$grp), ""))
   }
   ggplot(data = x, aes(x = cat, y = var)) + geom_point() +
     facet_wrap(~grp, drop=FALSE)
})

cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = plots_mydf, nrow = 5)

# Maybe more elegant output
plots_mydf <- lapply(s_mydf, function(x, ncol = 2){
   # Ensure no unused factors
   x$grp <- droplevels.factor(x$grp)
   x <- split(x, x$grp)

   p <- lapply(x, function(x){
     ggplot(data = x, aes(x = cat, y = var)) + geom_point() +
       facet_wrap(~grp)
   })

   if(length(p) < ncol){
     pe <- rep(list(ggplot() + theme_void()), ncol - length(p))
     p <- c(p, pe)
   }
   cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = p, ncol = ncol)
})

cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = plots_mydf, ncol = 1)

# Or if you prefer not to split the plots on the same row
plots_mydf <- lapply(s_mydf, function(x, ncol = 2){

   p <- list(ggplot(data = x, aes(x = cat, y = var)) + geom_point() +
     facet_wrap(~grp))

   if(length(unique(x$grp)) < ncol){
     pe <- rep(list(ggplot() + theme_void()), ncol - length(p))
     p <- c(p, pe)
   }else{
     ncol <- 1
   }
   cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = p, ncol = ncol)
})

cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = plots_mydf, ncol = 1)

If you want a function automating Karl's code, here it is. It returns an 
object of S3 class "htest", R's standard for hypothesis tests functions. 
The returned object can then be subset in the usual ways, ht$statistic, 
ht$parameter, ht$p.value, etc.


library(QSutils)

hutcheson.test <- function(x1, x2){
   dataname1 <- deparse(substitute(x1))
   dataname2 <- deparse(substitute(x2))
   method <- "Hutcheson's t-test for Shannon diversity equality"
   alternative <- "the diversities of the two samples are not equal"
   h1 <- Shannon(x1)
   varh1 <- ShannonVar(x1)
   n1 <- sum(x1)
   h2 <- Shannon(x2)
   varh2 <- ShannonVar(x2)
   n2 <- sum(x2)
   degfree <- (varh1 + varh2)**2 / (varh1**2/n1 + varh2**2/n2)
   tstat <- (h1 - h2)/sqrt(varh1 + varh2)
   p.value <- 2*pt(-abs(tstat), df = degfree)
   ht <- list(
     statistic = c(t = tstat),
     parameter = c(df = degfree),
     p.value = p.value,
     alternative = alternative,
     method = method,
     data.name = paste(dataname1, dataname2, sep = ", ")
   )
   class(ht) <- "htest"
   ht
}

earlier <- c(0,0,146,0,5,46,0,1,295,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0)
later <- c(0,0,142,0,5,46,0,1,246,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0)

hutcheson.test(earlier, later)



With the data you provided:


bird_1956 <- c(4,4,190,135,56,3,2,2,1,12,41,201,1,0,131,3)
bird_1957 <- c(4,111,53,66,146,222,126,61,0,2323,21)
bird_1958 <- c(0,3,32,228,56,102,0,11,2,220,0)
bird_1959 <- c(0,0,14,59,26,68,0)
bird_1960 <- c(0,0,73,66,71,25,0,109,63,1)

hutcheson.test(bird_1956, bird_1957)




Note that like David said earlier, there might be better ways to 
interpret Shannon's diversity index. If h is the sample's diversity, 
exp(h) gives the number of equally-common species with equivalent 
diversity.


s1 <- Shannon(earlier)
s2 <- Shannon(later)
c(earlier = s1, later = s2)
exp(c(earlier = s1, later = s2))   # Both round to 3
eq_common <- rep(1, 3)             # Can be 1 specimen or any other number
Shannon(eq_common)                 # Slightly greater than the samples' 
diversity


round(exp(sapply(birds, Shannon))) # Your data


#-------------------------------------


Earlier Karl wrote [1] that


Here var(h) is calculated as in ref 1 cited by Rui Barradas - I guess
that explains the minor numerical differences obtained with the code
above and the published variances.


I don't believe the published variances were computed with the published 
variance estimator. The code below computes the variances like QSutils 
and with formula (4) in Hutcheson's paper. The latter does not give the 
same results.

var_est <- function(n){
   s <- length(n)
   N <- sum(n)
   p <- n/N
   i <- p != 0
   inv.p <- numeric(s)
   inv.p[i] <- 1/p[i]
   log.p <- numeric(s)
   log.p[i] <- log(p[i])
   #
   term1 <- (sum(p * log.p^2) - sum(p * log.p)^2)/N
   term2 <- (s - 1)/(2*N^2)
   #
   numer3 <- -1 + sum(inv.p) - sum(inv.p * log.p) + sum(inv.p)*sum(p * 
log.p)
   denom3 <- 6*N^3
   term3 <- numer3/denom3
   list(
     Bioc = term1 + term2,
     Hutch = term1 + term2 + term3
   )
}

Vh1 <- var_est(earlier)
Vh1
all.equal(ShannonVar(earlier), Vh1$Bioc)
ShannonVar(earlier) - Vh1$Bioc            # FAQ 7.31

Vh2 <- var_est(later)
Vh2
identical(ShannonVar(later), Vh2$Bioc)    # TRUE

Hello,

Sorry, there's an instruction missing. See inline.

Thank you Ulrik for the suggestions.

I was thinking of a similar approach using a nested patchwork (which
would be easier for me).

It's just a shame that it is not possible to force a number of rows.
It's good that ggplot2 tries to do things in the most "appropriate" way,
but at some point, when the user decides it needs to have 5 rows, then
ggplot2 should listen, potentially issuing a warning like "the number of
rows specified is not appropriate, consider other values instead (e.g. 2)".

Best,
Ivan

PS: our email server is having troubles today, so I have not received
any other R-related emails. Are there few today or is it just me? There
might even be more answers to my question...

Hello,
thank you for the code. To explain better, when I used vegan, I did
not count the species directly but simply prepared a dataframe where,
for each species, I counted the number of samples bearing such
species:
```

> str(new_df)
'data.frame': 3 obs. of  46 variables:
 $ NC_001416 Enterobacteria phage lambda   : int  5 4 5
 $ NC_001623 Autographa californica nucl...: int  7 7 7
 $ NC_001895 Enterobacteria phage P2       : int  1 0 0
 $ NC_004745 Yersinia phage L-413C         : int  1 0 0
```
here the triplettes refer to healthy, tumor and metastasis. The outcome is:
```
# Shannon index
diversity(new_df)
#> Normal     Tumour     Metastasis
#> 2.520139   3.109512   1.890404
```
Using iNext, I provided a list of all the species counted in a samples
```
> new_list
$Healthy
 [1] 5 7 1 1 1 8 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

$Tumour
 [1] 4 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0

$Metastasis
 [1] 5 7 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1
```
>From this I get:
```
mod = iNEXT(new_list, q=0, datatype="abundance")
mod$AsyEst
#Site         Diversity Observed Estimator   s.e.    LCL     UCL
#1     Normal  Species richness   18.000    41.368 19.683 23.563 116.155
#2     Normal Shannon diversity   12.430    21.343  5.183 12.430  31.501
#4     Tumour  Species richness   30.000    94.776 42.936 49.848 241.396
#5     Tumour Shannon diversity   22.410    53.135 14.486 24.743  81.526
#7 Metastasis  Species richness   10.000    27.379 22.821 12.443 133.640
#8 Metastasis Shannon diversity    6.622     9.980  3.102  6.622  16.059
```
So here the Shannon index is 12 instead of 2.5...
Using Karl's function, I get:
```
# compute Shannon
norm_sIdx <- Shannon(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[1]))))
canc_sIdx <- Shannon(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[2]))))
meta_sIdx <- Shannon(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[3]))))
norm_var <- ShannonVar(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[1]))))
canc_var <- ShannonVar(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[2]))))
meta_var <- ShannonVar(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[3]))))
norm_sum <- sum(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[1]))))
canc_sum <- sum(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[2]))))
meta_sum <- sum(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[3]))))
# compute Hutcheson
degfree <- (norm_var + canc_var)**2 /(norm_var**2/norm_sum +
canc_var**2 /canc_sum)
test <- (norm_sIdx-canc_sIdx) /sqrt(norm_var + canc_var)
(p <- 2*pt(-abs(test),df= degree))
> [1] 0.01825784
```
remarkably, the indices are the same as obtained by vegan:
```
> norm_sIdx
[1] 2.520139
> canc_sIdx
[1] 3.109512
> meta_sIdx
[1] 1.890404
```

I tried Rui's function but I got an error, so I wrote it as
```
hutcheson = function(A, B){
  # compute Shannon index, variance and sum of elements
  A_index <- Shannon(A)
  B_index <- Shannon(B)
  A_var <- ShannonVar(A)
  B_var <- ShannonVar(B)
  A_sum <- sum(A)
  B_sum <- sum(B)
  # compute Hutcheson
  DF <- (A_var + B_var)^2 /(A_var^2/A_sum + B_var^2/B_sum)
  test <- (A_index-B_index) /sqrt(A_var + B_var)
  p <- 2*pt(-abs(test),df= DF)
  # closure
  cat("Hutcheson's t-test for Shannon diversity equality\n\tShannon
index first group: ",
      round(A_index, 4), "\n\tShannon index second group: ", round(B_index, 4),
      "\n\tp-value : ", round(p, 4), "\n", sep = "")
  return(p)
}
```
and I got:
```

> n_t = hutcheson(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[1]))), array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[2]))))
Hutcheson's t-test for Shannon diversity equality
Shannon index first group: 2.5201
Shannon index second group: 3.1095
p-value : 0.0183
> n_m = hutcheson(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[1]))), array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[3]))))
Hutcheson's t-test for Shannon diversity equality
Shannon index first group: 2.5201
Shannon index second group: 1.8904
p-value : 0.0371
> t_m = hutcheson(array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[2]))), array(as.numeric(unlist(new_list[3]))))
Hutcheson's t-test for Shannon diversity equality
Shannon index first group: 3.1095
Shannon index second group: 1.8904
p-value : 0
```
new_list[1]|[2]|[3] refer to healthy, tumor and metastasis. applied to
the original Hutcheson data:
```
> bird_1956 <- c(4,4,190,135,56,3,2,2,1,12,41,201,1,0,131,3)
> bird_1957 <- c(4,111,53,66,146,222,126,61,0,2323,21)
> hutcheson(bird_1956, bird_1957)
Hutcheson's t-test for Shannon diversity equality
Shannon index first group: 1.8429
Shannon index second group: 1.0689
p-value : 0

```
This is to compare two groups at the time. I'll probably have to
compensate for multiple testing...
But if this all OK, then the case is closed.
Thank you

Update:
I also added the confidence interval for the Shannon index:
```
#! Hutcheson's t-test for Shannon diversity equality
# thanks to Karl Schilling and Rui Barradas
hutcheson = function(A, B){
  # compute Shannon index, variance and sum of elements
  A_index <- Shannon(A)
  B_index <- Shannon(B)
  A_var <- ShannonVar(A)
  B_var <- ShannonVar(B)
  A_sum <- sum(A)
  B_sum <- sum(B)
  # compute Hutcheson
  DF <- (A_var + B_var)^2 /(A_var^2/A_sum + B_var^2/B_sum)
  test <- (A_index-B_index) /sqrt(A_var + B_var)
  p <- 2*pt(-abs(test),df= DF)
  if (p < 0.001) {
    P = "<0.001"
  } else {
    P = round(p, 3)
  }
  if (p < 0.001) {
    S = "***"
  } else if (p < 0.01) {
    S = "**"
  } else if (p < 0.05) {
    S = "*"
  } else {
    S = ""
  }
  # closure
  cat("Hutcheson's t-test for Shannon diversity equality\n\tShannon
index first group: \t",
      round(A_index, 3), " (", round((A_index-2*A_var),3), "-",
round((A_index+2*A_var),3),
      ")\n\tShannon index second group: \t",
      round(B_index, 3), " (", round((B_index-2*B_var),3), "-",
round((B_index+2*B_var),3),
      ")\n\tp-value: ", P, " ", S, "\n", sep = "")
  return(p)
}
```

Hello,
I have just realized in the original paper, the t test is defined as:
`t = h1-h2 -(?1?2)/(var1-var2)^1/2`. is the term -(?1?2) missing in
your formula? How to calculate ?1?2?
Thank you

Actually,
in the working example, Hutcheson himself did not report the term

Dear Luigi:

no, ?1?2 is not "missing"

First, it should actually be "?1 - ?2".

And as your usual null-hypothesis when comparing h1 and h2 is that they 
are not different (i.e. ?1 = ?2), the latter term adds up to 0 and may 
be omitted.

Subject: [R] Adjusting The size and Orientation of x-axis labes for Pareto
 Charts
Message-ID: <CAMOcQfPqt7z=psP2FdwukTtQYVHBsEB-Uy=4xwQcAhx8wbRa6g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

Hope you are doing well. I am currently using R version 3.6.2. I installed
and loaded package qcc by Mr. Luca Scrucca.

I generated the pareto chart using qcc?s pareto.chart function, but when
the graph gets generated, the x-axis labels aren?t fully shown, and so the
text can?t be viewed properly.

Is there any way to adjust the x-axis labels (font and orientation), so
that they can be easily shown?

This is the structure of my data:

str(dataset2)
'data.frame':   140 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ School: Factor w/ 140 levels "24 de Diciembre",..: 39 29 66 16 67 116 35
106 65 17 ...
 $ Points: num  55 43 24 21 20 20 18 17 16 16 ...


Below is the dput() of my dataset.

Hi.

You could try call pareto.chart with las=2 option.

See ?par.

But I am not sure if it will work as I do not have experience with this.

Cheers
Petr

Subject: [R] monthly mean for each month and each year in the data frame
Message-ID: <8B435C9568170B469AE31E8891E8CC4F809F7883@ESINO.regionemarche.intra>

Dear R-list users,
I know that this is a trivial question, but I already wasted quite a large amount of time on that.
I have a data frame with daily data of snow fall. I need to evaluate the monthly mean for each month and each year in the data frame.
Could you help me to find an eficient way for these calculations?

Thank you for your help
Stefano

Here a reproducibile code:

first_day_1 <- as.POSIXct("2019-01-19-00-00", format="%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")
last_day_1 <- as.POSIXct("2019-03-20-00-00", format="%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")
df1 <- data.frame(data_POSIX=seq(first_day_1, last_day_1, by="1 days"))
df1$value <- runif(nrow(df1), 0, 10)


first_day_2 <- as.POSIXct("2020-02-19-00-00", format="%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")
last_day_2 <- as.POSIXct("2020-04-20-00-00", format="%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")
df2 <- data.frame(data_POSIX=seq(first_day_2, last_day_2, by="1 days"))
df2$value <- runif(nrow(df2), 0, 10)

df <- rbind(df1, df2)

Hi Stefano,
What about this?

df$months<-format(df$data_POSIX,"%Y-%m")
snow_means<-by(df$value,df$months,mean)

Hello,

Here are two aggregate options, the first base R only, the second one 
with package zoo.


year_month <- format(df$data_POSIX, "%Y-%m")
aggregate(value ~ year_month, df, mean)    # or even value ~ format(etc)
#  year_month    value
#1    2019-01 6.430922

This results is shown just for one ID (rs11101905) there is about 2
million of those in the resulting file.

My question is how do I present/plot the effect of covariate "TD" in
the example it has "P" equal to 3.32228e-12 for all IDs in the
resulting file so that I show how much effect covariate "TD" has on
the analysis. Should I run another regression without covariate "TD"
and than do scatter plot of P values with and without "TD" covariate
or there is a better way to do this from the data I already have?

Thanks
Ana

Thank you again.
I finally used aggregate because it build a data frame straight away.

Oggetto: Re: [R] monthly mean for each month and each year in the data frame

Hello,

Here are two aggregate options, the first base R only, the second one
with package zoo.


year_month <- format(df$data_POSIX, "%Y-%m")
aggregate(value ~ year_month, df, mean)    # or even value ~ format(etc)
#  year_month    value
#1    2019-01 6.430922
#2    2019-02 4.846731
#3    2019-03 4.968503
#4    2020-02 6.484031
#5    2020-03 4.910305
#6    2020-04 4.906575


aggregate(value ~ zoo::as.yearmon(data_POSIX), df, mean)
#  zoo::as.yearmon(data_POSIX)    value
#1                    jan 2019 6.430922
#2                    fev 2019 4.846731
#3                    mar 2019 4.968503
#4                    fev 2020 6.484031

Message-ID: <CAF9-5jPBuTcmJXUkp63_7zd3nkoB8X4+jiSeMWLpjU4VATVyDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a vector like this:

"NPSR1-AS1"        "NPSR1-AS1"             "AAAS"

it has around 15000 entries. How do I replace all values with NA
expect these that are named like this:

geneSymbol[c("0lQ1XozriVZTn.PezY","uaeFiCdegrnWFijF_s","ZOluqaxSe3ndekoNng","912ny6eCHjnlY2XSCU","odF3XHR8CVl4SAUaUQ")]

sorry not replace with NA but with empty string for a name, for example

for example this:

> geneSymbol["Ku8QhfS0n_hIOABXuE"]
Ku8QhfS0n_hIOABXuE
           "MACC1"

would go when I subject it to

> geneSymbol["Ku8QhfS0n_hIOABXuE"]

Ku8QhfS0n_hIOABXuE

I can't understand non-words with that many letters.  I think this is what you
are looking for:

> tmp <- c(A="a",B="b",C="c",D="d")
> names(tmp)
[1] "A" "B" "C" "D"
> tmp
  A   B   C   D
"a" "b" "c" "d"
> ## change values of B and C to "x" and "y"
> names(tmp) %in% c("B","C")
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
> tmp[names(tmp) %in% c("B","C")]
  B   C
"b" "c"
> tmp[names(tmp) %in% c("B","C")] <- c("x","y")
> tmp
  A   B   C   D
"a" "x" "y" "d"
>

If not, please ask the question again with simpler-appearing vectors and show
us what you would like the answer to be.

Subject: [R] Function that finds elements from matrix,
 and saves the indices of the elements to another matrix
Message-ID: <CAECDQQHAJ7MFGwzq9u4WwmwMru83Aqtn-p8NpBF4CzJ8_JXoQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all dear R-list users,

This might sound a silly problem, but but for one reason or another it has
proved unsolvable to me.

I need to solve the following task. I have tried to use two nested for
loops as a solution, but have not been able to made it work. It would be
great, if someone could formulate a code for me:

I need to create a function X that takes as its input a 10x10 matrix, which
elements consists of ones and zeros. The function X must find the elements
in the matrix A that are "ones", and save the indices of those elements in
2-column matrix, in a following way: the first column has a row number, and
the second a column number.

The answer should be formulated in a way, that it uses two nested for
loops. The matrix to be returned has a maximum of 100 rows, so one
possibility exists for a 100x2 matrix filled with zeros in the index and
finally separate those rows with zeros.

I have tried the following code:

A<-matrix(1:0, nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

X <- data.frame()
for (i in seq(1, nrow(A))) {
for (j in seq(1,ncol(A))) {
if (A [i,j] > 0) {

new_row <- data.frame(Row_number= rownames(A)[i], Column_number=
colnames(A)[j])

X <- rbind(X, new_row)

  }

  }
}

I only manage to get "Error: object 'X' not found", as a result.

thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: [R] question including crossover trials in meta-analysis

Dear sir/madam,
Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my question. I am currently trying to conduct a meta-analysis combining parallel and crossover trials. According to the Cochrane Handbook, I can include crossover trials by using t-paired statistics. So far, I have managed to conduct a meta-analysis and forest plot of the parallel trials using the dmetar package, but I did not succeed in including the crossover trials. I do have the raw data of most of these crossover trials.
Does anybody know how to add crossover trials to the meta-analysis?
With kind regards,
Vera Belgers

Subject: [R] How to reduce the sparseness in a TDM to make a cluster plot
 readable?
Message-ID: <c6722f2d-e4a7-f981-0624-4a9a517b76f9@gmail.com>

Hello all

I am doing some text mining on a set of five plain text files and have 
run into a snag when I run hclust in that there are just too many leaves 
for anything to be read. It returns a solid black line.

The texts have been converted into a TDM which has a dim of 5,292 and 5 
(as per 5 docs).

My code for removing sparsity is as follows:

 > tdm2 <- removeSparseTerms(tdm, sparse=0.99999)

 > inspect(tdm2)

<<TermDocumentMatrix (terms: 5292, documents: 5)>>
Non-/sparse entries: 10415/16045
Sparsity?????????? : 61%
Maximal term length: 22
Weighting????????? : term frequency (tf)

While the tf-idf weighting returns this when 0.99999 sparseness is removed:

 > inspect(tdm.tfidf)
<<TermDocumentMatrix (terms: 5292, documents: 5)>>
Non-/sparse entries: 7915/18545
Sparsity?????????? : 70%
Maximal term length: 22
Weighting????????? : term frequency - inverse document frequency 
(normalized) (tf-idf)

I have experimented by decreasing the value I use for decreasing 
sparseness, and that helps a bit, for example:

 > tdm2 <- removeSparseTerms(tdm, sparse=0.215)
 > inspect(tdm2)
<<TermDocumentMatrix (terms: 869, documents: 5)>>
Non-/sparse entries: 3976/369
Sparsity?????????? : 8%
Maximal term length: 14
Weighting????????? : term frequency (tf)

But, no matter what I do, the resulting plot is unreadable. The code for 
plotting the cluster is:

 > hc <- hclust(dist(tdm2, method = "euclidean"), method = "complete")
 > plot(hc, yaxt = 'n', main = "Hierarchical clustering")

Can someone kindly either advise me what I am doing wrong and/ or 
signpost me to some detailed info on how to fix this.

Many thanks in anticipation.

Andy

Is this a homework problem? We try not to do others' homework here.

Incidentally, this can easily be done much more efficiently without any
for() loops.

Hi,

Bert has pointed you to some R specific packages for meta-analyses via the Task View.

It sounds like you may need to first address some underlying conceptual issues, which strictly speaking, is off-topic for this list.

That being said, a quick Google search came up with some possible resources, beyond the Cochrane reference:

  https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/31/1/140/655940

  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jrsm.1236

  https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133023


Perhaps with additional conceptual background, that might assist in enabling you to make use of the R packages that provide relevant functionality.

Another option, if you want to stay with the dmetar package, would be to contact the package maintainer for some guidance relative to how to use the functionality in the package given your specific use case.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Hi everyone.

I'd like to perform RIDIT scoring of a column that consists of ordinal  
values, but I don't have a comparison dataset to use against it as  
required by the Ridit::ridit function.

As a question of best practice, could I use a normally distributed  
frequency distribution table generated by the rnorm function for use  
as comparison data for RIDIT scoring?

Or would I be better off using a 2nd ordinal variable from the same  
dataframe for comparison?



Thanks in advance!

Generally speaking, statistical questions like this are O/T here. This list
is mostly about R programming issues. While there is a non-null
intersection, I would nevertheless suggest that you post on
stats.stackexchange.com instead.

I'm wondering if you want one of these:
(1) Plots of "Main Effects".
(2) "Partial Residual Plots".

Search for them, and you should be able to tell if they're what you want.

But a word of warning:

Many people (including many senior statisticians) misinterpret this
kind of information.
Because, it's always the effect of xj on Y, while holding the other
variables *constant*.
That's not as simple as it sounds, and people have a tendency of
disregarding the importance of the second half of that sentence, in
their final interpretations.


P.S.
John Fox, announced a package with support for Regression Diagnostics,
about 11 days ago:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2020-September/468609.html

I'm not sure how relevant it is to your question, but I just glanced
at the vignette, and it's pretty slick...

Dear Vera

In addition to what you already have you might like to know about the 
mailing list specifically dedicated to meta-analysis in R.

https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-meta-analysis//

You might like to search the archives first as this sort of issue does 
come up there. You are also likely to get more immediate help if you 
frame your question in terms of either meta or metafor the two packages 
which dmetar uses. The authors of meta and metafor all frequent the list

I have file have two columns? . data in this file is text just (G1,G2,G3? to G154). one element? can repeat, no problem ,so? we have 23562 rows in two columns (for 154 elements) like :

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] salesforcer v0.2.2: An Implementation of Salesforce
 APIs Using Tidy Principles
Message-ID: <CACv7DjrMyugPt1baeCpbPWqbfpEE83_YrenWciHkUt8V0jHFSA@mail.gmail.com>

The {salesforcer} package allows users to query and analyze Salesforce data
and administer their Org's records and object metadata (fields, triggers,
layouts). It has been three years in the making to map multiple
Salesforce Platform
APIs for use in R. The package implements the REST, SOAP, Bulk 1.0, Bulk
2.0, Metadata, and Reports and Dashboards APIs. If you or your colleagues
maintain or analyze Salesforce data, then I would greatly appreciate your
use and feedback of this package. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Steven M. Mortimer

Subject: [R] How to represent the effect of one covariate on regression
 results?

Hi Abby and David,

Thanks for the useful tips! I will check those.

I completed the regression analysis in plink (as R would be very slow
for my sample size) but as I mentioned I need to determine the
influence of a specific covariate in my results and Plink is of no
help there.

I did Pearson correlation analysis for P values which I got in
regression with and without my covariate of interest and I got this:

> cor.test(tt$P_TD, tt$P_noTD, method = "pearson", conf.level = 0.95)

    Pearson's product-moment correlation

data:  tt$P_TD and tt$P_noTD
t = 20.17, df = 283, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.7156134 0.8117108
sample estimates:
      cor
0.7679493

I can see the p values are very correlated in those two instances. Can
I conclude that my covariate then doesn't have a huge effect or what
kind of conclusion I can draw from that?

Thanks for all your help
Ana

Subject: [R] X axis labels are not fully shown when using pareto.chart
 function
Message-ID: <CAMOcQfMvjEuE9EFFC0W_W3XQHP9jmFEX8W6338Cek0YY8xgUgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

Hope you are doing well. I am currently using R version 3.6.2. I installed
and loaded package qcc by Mr. Luca Scrucca.

Hopefully someone can tell me if there is a workaround for the issue I am
experiencing.

I generated the pareto chart using qcc?s pareto.chart function, but when
the graph gets generated, the x-axis labels aren?t fully shown (some labels
get truncated), and so the text can?t be viewed properly.

Is there any way to adjust the x-axis labels (font and orientation), so
that they can be easily shown?

This is the structure of my data:

str(dataset2)
'data.frame':   140 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ School: Factor w/ 140 levels "24 de Diciembre",..: 39 29 66 16 67 116 35
106 65 17 ...
 $ Points: num  55 43 24 21 20 20 18 17 16 16 ...

Dear sir/madam,
Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my question. I am currently trying to conduct a meta-analysis combining parallel and crossover trials. According to the Cochrane Handbook, I can include crossover trials by using t-paired statistics. So far, I have managed to conduct a meta-analysis and forest plot of the parallel trials using the dmetar package, but I did not succeed in including the crossover trials. I do have the raw data of most of these crossover trials.
Does anybody know how to add crossover trials to the meta-analysis?
With kind regards,

Subject: [R] How to represent the effect of one covariate on regression

I'll take a second shot in the dark:

There is R^2, and a number of generalizations.
(The most common of which, is probably adjusted R^2).
And there are various other goodness of fit tests.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination

You could fit two models (one with a particular variable included, and
one without), and compare how the statistic changes.

However, I'm probably going to get told off, for going off-topic.
So, unless any further questions are specific to R programming, I
don't think I'm going to contribute further.

Also, I'd recommend you read some notes on statistical modelling, or
consult an expert, or both.
And I suspect there are additional considerations modelling genetic data.

The above is nested json.

I want the output to be as below
dataElements.name,dataElements.id,categoryOptionCombos.name,categoryOptionCombos.id

Any help in r?

That sounds great. Is there any similar package that works with SuiteCRM or SugarCRM?

Hi Paul,
This looks very familiar to me, but I'll send my previous suggestion.

library(qcc)
x11(width=13,height=5)
pareto.chart(dataset2$Points,xaxt="n")
library(plotrix)
staxlab(1,at=seq(0.035,0.922,length.out=140),
 labels=substr(dataset2$School,1,20),srt=90,cex=0.5)

I do not think it follows from the correlation of p-values that your 
covariate "does not have a huge effect". P-values are not really data, 
although they are random values. A simulation study of this would 
require a much better description of the original dataset. Again, that 
is something that the users of Plink are more likely to be able to 
intuit than are we. I still do not see why this question is not being 
addressed to the users of the software from which you are deriving your 
"data".

Hi David,

thanks for the useful insight I did of course wrote to plink user
group but no answer there. I guess they are more concerned about how
to run commands with plink as oppose to interpret results.

What I can tell about my cohort is that about 80% of cases had Type 2
diabetes while about 8% had Type 1. (my TD covariate is reference for
the type of diabetes) In the attach is the description of the data.

Cheers,
Ana

Dear Jim,

Thank you so much for your valuable and kind reply. I will try what you
suggest and will let you and the group members how that goes.

Can the resolution you suggest be applied whenever I encounter an issue
like the one I just described (to make x-axis labels clearly visible)? I
imagine if work with some other x-axis labels I'd just have to play around
with the width, height, srt and cex parameters?

Best regards,

Paul

Hi Paul,
It is a contest between the quantity of information and legibility.
You have 140 labels to place on the x-axis in your plot and I barely
managed it by almost doubling the width of the plot, halving the size
of the font and truncating the labels to a maximum of 20 characters.
Unless you want to follow something like Google Maps, where the
information springs up in a little balloon, you are close to the
limits of a static display. That said, you are correct in saying that
staxlab will cram a lot of information at the edges of a plot.

Hi

 

It is recommended to keep your emails in Rhelp, there are others who could give you answer.

 

If I understand correctly you want to take 2 lines in your data frame and test them if they are same but just reversed.

 

One option could be to split the whole data frame in chunks. Based on your example

 

test <- structure(list(V1 = c("G1", "G2", "G3", "G1", "G20", "G21"), 

    V2 = c("G2", "G1", "G1", "G3", "G21", "G16")), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -6L))

test.l <- split(test, rep(1:3, each=2))

res <- rep(NA, length(test.l))

for (i in 1:length(test.l)) res[i] <- prod(as.numeric(factor(unlist(test.l[[i]]))))

test$column3 <- rep(res==4, each=2)*1

 

Maybe some clever matrix operations could do it in more elegant way.

 

Cheers

Petr

thanks petr v much 
i attached my problem in word and my data 
i want take all elements them have relations not just G1 and G2 this just example test (G1 AND G2) i want make loop to take all elements:

G1 G2 1 
G2 G1 1
G3 G1 1
G1 G3 1
G20 G21 0
G21 G16 0 
(notice (G1 and G2 have relation and G3 and G1 also have but G20 ,G21,G16 do not have this relations we put 0 ,

(i have G1 to G154) them make 23400 relation i want to know wich forn theses relations are true (1) or not (0)

i hope you can help me.

The following works:

library(qcc)
x = dataset2$Points 
names(x) = dataset2$School
par(oma = c(2,0,0,0))
pareto.chart(x)
             
You may need to adjust the oma parameter. 

BTW, next time please provide a reproducible example. I spent more time to figure out which is the correct variable/label to plot than to find the solution to your problem.
