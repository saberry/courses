# Step 1

In "surveyMaterials" folder, you will find 2 documents. These surveys are pretty 
famous in the Organizational Behavior world and it is typically administered in 
the format that you see. Pick one of these surveys, review it, and make improvements 
to the survey in a text file. You do not need to recreate the entire survey, 
but definitely hit the points where you see the most need for improvement.

# Step 2

You will notice that these two surveys share a large portion of the same 
questions. That information, coupled with the names of the surveys, should 
give you a pretty good idea that one of these surveys is completed by an 
employee about his/her boss and the other survey is to be completed by the 
boss about his/her self perceptions. 
Create a survey in Qualtrics (ideally using the text file from Step 1) 
that will caputre data from both the employee and the boss. This should be one 
survey that branches correctly and uses appropriate logic. 
You do not need to create the entire survey; you may pick one of the leadership 
styles and a few of the other questions that are specific to each group. 

# Step 3

In the data folder, you will find an RData file (hint: you can use the load 
function to bring this data in and you do not need to assign it a name). 
Perform a factor analysis for the leadership style that you included in your 
survey and one other leadership style. Report your factor loadings and what 
that means for these items. You should also check the reliability of 
these two measures and report the alpha value.
