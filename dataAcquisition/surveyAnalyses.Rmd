## Measurement & Latent Variables

If I asked you your height, could you tell me? How do you know your height and what allowed you to know your height? Like most, you have probably been measured at the doctor's office with some device marked with inches.

Now, if I were to ask you how you felt, what would you tell me? You might say that you are feeling well or not feeling too well, but how did you measure this? Did you use your wellness measuring tape or your wellness balance beam -- unlikely. Instead, you likely thought about everything going on -- your current health, general mood, and whatever else you deemed important at the time. Put another way, I could essentially be asking your about your affect (mood). Unfortunately, we can't measure your affect like we can measure your height. There is no agreed upon method for measuring your current affect (there isn't even an argument between Imperial and metric to be had).

Affect is an example of a latent variable -- we have a pretty good idea that it exists and we have operationalized it, but there is no way that we can physically measure it. If we think of what latent tends to mean, hidden, we start to understand what latent variables are -- variables that are hidden, but still interesting. Instead, we have to rely on a series of questions that gets us close to what we think is affect. This process of "getting at" affect through questions is what is known as *measurement*. You have been involved with measurement for a very long time, even if you did not know it. If you ever took a high-stakes standardized test (e.g., GRE, GMAT, LSAT), then you were directly involved in measurement -- we can't actually measure the mass of your mathematical reasoning ability, so we have to ask questions to measure that ability.

An important part of measurement concerns error. Error can come from many different sources (measure, person, environment, etc.) and "distorts" the observed score.

### On Principal Compenents Analysis And Factor Analysis

You might have already learned about a technique used for taking items and reducing them down -- principal components analysis (PCA). People will even tell you that they are the same thing. The logical question is are factor analysis and pca the same things? They are both matrix factorization techniques, but the similarities start to end pretty quickly after that.

  - Causal direction: In PCA, the items are the cause of the component. In factor analysis, the latent factor gives rise to the items (i.e., the items reflect the construct -- questions for mathematical reason exist because there is a construct for mathematical reasoning that exists beyond the existence of the items).
  
  - Component/Factor Interpretation: These is no interpretation of a component -- it simply exists to reduce the variables. Factors represent the latent variables are important.
  
  - Variance: PCA attempts to extract as much variance as possible from the items. Each succesive component after the first will extract less variance than the first
  
  - Measurement error: PCA assumes perfect measurement. In PCA, the item correlation matrix maintains 1's on the diagonal; in factor analysis, the diagonal gets adjusted.

The psych package will make life easy for us. Let's see what these differences mean in terms of our output:

```{r}
library(dplyr)

library(psych)

testData <- bfi %>% 
  select(starts_with("A", ignore.case = FALSE), 
         starts_with("C"))

testPCA <- principal(r = testData, nfactors = 2, rotate = "none")

testFA <- fa(r = testData, nfactors = 2, rotate = "none")

testPCA

testFA
```

While items might load on the same factor/component, the magnitudes are much different. We also see differences in communality (h2 -- coarsely, it is a marker of item reliability and is similar to R2) and item uniqueness (u2 -- variance that is unique to the item and not the factor/component). We can also see that our PCA extracted more variance from the items than did our EFA (.48 to .36). PCA will always extract more variance, because EFA extracts common variance (i.e., the variance that is shared by all of the items). 

## Determining Factor Numbers

Determining the appropriate number of factors in an exploratory factor analysis can be complex. How many might theory dictate? Is there a strong theory at all? In an exploratory setting, it is helpful to conduct something called a parallel analysis (PA). PA is a Monte Carlo simulation that takes into account the number of items and rows within your data and then produces a random matrix of the same shape.

```{r}
psych::fa.parallel(testData)
```

This is the most automated way of finding a potentially suitable number of factors. We are given some output appropriate for both factor analysis and principal components analysis, with a graphical representation provided. In this case, parallel analysis would suggest 4 factors to be retained for a factor analysis. If some theory exists, you can also use that information to guide your factor numbers. 

While you will often get some different results, you can also use the nfactors function:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
testData %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  psych::nfactors()
```

Now we are provided a variety of different metrics for determining the number of factors to retain. We can see that the suggested number of factors range from 2 (very simple structure with complexity 1 and MAP) to 5 (very simple structure with complexity 2). Given the results of our parallel analysis and our sample size adjusted BIC, we could make a good argument for retaining 4 factors.

## Rotation

You might remember how we rotate axes to try to get our components to fit together better. Generally, PCA forces an orthogonal rotation -- in other words, the vertices will always maintain 90s. Factor analysis, will allow for orthogonal rotations, but also oblique rotations (the vertices can go above or below 90). While pictures certainly help, there is something very important at play here. As you remember from PCA, an orthogonal rotation would hold that the factors (or components) are not correlated. For components, this makes sense. For our scale, however, would you guess that the items being analzyed are not correlated? By using an oblique rotation, we are allowing the factors to be as correlated as necessary.

Our rotations, though not terribly different, will produce different loading patterns.

```{r}
orthRotation <- fa(r = testData, nfactors = 2, rotate = "varimax")

obliqueRotation <- fa(r = testData, nfactors = 2, rotate = "promax")

orthRotation

obliqueRotation
```

We can see that our oblique rotation produces a correlation of .34 between the two factors. I will leave it up to you to determine if that is a strong enough correlation to warrant an orthogonal rotation. An orthogonal rotation, while limiting the correlation between factors, does produce "cleaner" results. If the factors are not correlated, we can interpret each one in isolation. In an oblique rotation with correlated factors, we have to interpret the factors simultaneously and consider how items loading on multiple factors behave. 

## Factor Loadings

We can think of factor loadings as the correlation between an item and a factor -- they are interpreted in this manner.

Let's take a peak at the factor loadings of our oblique solution from above:

```{r}
obliqueRotation$loadings
```

We can see that our output is hiding values of small magnitude (refer to the previous results for all values) -- this is for ease in examining the loading matrix and we could consider these as neglible loadings given the weakness of the loading. We can read these very much in the same way that we read correlations. For factor 1 (MR1 in the output), we see that items C1 through C5 load pretty strongly (with A4 having a weak loading). So, someone who offers a high response on C5 might have lower values of whatever latent trait is being measured, while they might have high values of the latent trait if they respond with a higher value on question C2.

## Factor Scoring

We have gone through the necessary steps of performing our factor analysis to this point, but what do we ultimately get out of it? In the end, we want to take our factors and produce some type of score.

What kind of score should we produce? If we use the numeric values given by the observed variables (e.g., 1-5, 0-4), then we can imagine producing some type of aggregate score (i.e., a sum or an average score). THe following is a typical exercise:

```{r}
testData <- testData %>% 
  mutate(agreeAverage = (sum(A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, na.rm = TRUE) / 5), 
         consAverage = (sum(C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, na.rm = TRUE) / 5))
```


Do those aggregate scores tell the complete truth? Remember how we just talked about loadings? The factor loadings are essentially telling us how much the variable is related to the factor. If we use a simple aggregate score, is that relationship captured? I am afraid not; aggregate scores are going to give the same weight to every item, regardless of how highly it loads on any given factor. What about cross-loadings? This type of aggregate scoring would completely ignore them!

Instead, we can use factor scores. There are several different types of factor scores that we can compute, but we are going to compute Thurstone scores. 

$$W=R^{-1}F$$
*R* is the correlation matrix between the items and *F* are the factor loadings.

Thurstone score are incredibly easy to produce by hand, so let's give it a try.

To compute those scores, we need to produce a correlation matrix of our observed scores. For simplicity, let see what a one factor model would look like.

```{r}
agreeDat <- bfi %>% 
  select(starts_with("A", ignore.case = FALSE))

agreeCorrs <- cor(agreeDat, use = "pairwise")
```


Then, we need to get the loadings from our factor analysis results:

```{r}
agreeFA <- fa(agreeCorrs, rotate = "promax", scores = "regression")

agreeLoadings = agreeFA$loadings[1:5, 1]
```

Now, we have everything that we need: item loadings, item correlations, and observed scores.

The first step is to get the matrix product between the inverse correlation matrix and the factor loading matrix:

```{r}
w <- solve(agreeCorrs, agreeLoadings)
```


Finally, we center and scale the observed data, and do matrix multiplication for the product w that we just found:

```{r}
agreeScaled <- agreeDat %>% 
  scale(., center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

facScores <- agreeScaled %*% w

head(facScores)
```


We can check these against those returned from our results:

```{r}
head(predict(agreeFA, agreeDat))
```

Now, let's see how well those scores are correlated with simple aggregate scores.

```{r}
simpleScores <- agreeDat %>% 
  mutate(simpleScore = rowMeans(.))
```

```{r}
cor(facScores[, 1], simpleScores$simpleScore, use = "complete")
```

We can see that the scores are certainly correlated, but the factor scores are likely closer to *true scores*.

## Reliability

Factor analysis falls under a broader notion of what is called *Classical Testing Theory* (CTT). In CTT, the notion of reliability is of supreme importance. Reliability is most easily defined as being able to produce the same result from a measure. If I give you the same measure a few months apart and you score similarly on both measures, then we are likely dealing with a reliable test. It is important to note that reliable is not the same as valid. Validity, with regard to measurement, is knowing that our measure is measuring what we intend it to measure (e.g., our measure of likelihood to engage in whistleblowing is actually measuring a person's likelihood to blow the whistle). A measure can be reliable without being valid -- remember it just has to produce the same results time after time. 

Assessing reliability is generally an easy task. The most simple version of reliability is Cronbach's measure of internal consistency, or $\alpha$. Cronbach's $\alpha$ is simply the best split-half correlation within a measure (internal consistency means that the whole measure is reliable within itself). 

$$\alpha = \frac{N\bar{c}}{\bar{v} + (N-1) \bar{c}} $$

*N* is the number of items, $\bar{c}$ is the average inter-item covariance, and $\bar{v}$ is the average variance. We can get all of that information from the covariance matrix: the variances are on the diagonal and inter-item covariances are in the triangles. 

```{r}
cor(agreeDat, use = "complete.obs")

agreeDat$A1 <- abs(agreeDat$A1 - (max(agreeDat$A1, na.rm = TRUE) + 1))

cor(agreeDat, use = "complete.obs")

covarianceMatrix <- cov(agreeDat, use = "complete.obs")

# The following is also mean(apply(agreeDat, 2, var, na.rm = TRUE)), 
# if you are wanting to kick some more base R around.

V <- mean(diag(covarianceMatrix)) 

C <- mean(covarianceMatrix[lower.tri(covarianceMatrix)])

N <- length(agreeDat)

cAlpha <- (N * C) / (V + ((N - 1) * C))

cAlpha
```

We can also compute the standardized version of alpha, by using the correlation matrix:

```{r}
sumR <- sum(cov2cor(covarianceMatrix))

(1 - N/sumR) * (N/(N - 1))
```

While that was all pretty easy, I think getting $\alpha$ is easy enough from psych:

```{r}
psych::alpha(agreeDat, check.keys = TRUE)
```

We get a fair chunk of output, but let's just focus on the "std.alpha" value of .71. By most "rules-of-thumb", anything of .7 is acceptable for general purpose use. If we were wanting to make very important decisions with our measure, we might look for something approaching or exceeding .9. 

You likely noticed the "check.keys = TRUE" arguement -- alpha is bound by test length and item correlations. In a case where some items are negatively correlated, that will greatly reduce our $\alpha$ coefficient. Let's try it for ourselves:

```{r}
psych::alpha(agreeDat)
```

Very different, right?

We did all of this to say that $\alpha$ helps us to know how consistent a one factor measure is within itself. In many circumstances where you find yourself with a unidimensional factor structure, $\alpha$ will be more than sufficient for convincing people that your scale is reliable (weaknesses aside).

There are, however, many other forms of reliability ($\alpha$ is based off of something else called the Kuder-Richardson 20). One popular and conceptually helpful form of reliability is McDonald's $\omega$. McDonald's $\omega$ is well-suited for hierarchical factor structures, in which you might have various subscales that assess something bigger. 

Earlier, we played with the bfi data. Let's return to that, but with a hypothesis that the 5 factors of the bfi are actually subfactors of some larger latent personality variable.

```{r}
bfiSubFactors <- bfi %>% 
  select(-gender, -education, -age)

omegaTest <- psych::omega(bfiSubFactors, nfactors = 5, 
             rotate = "promax", plot = FALSE)

omega.diagram(omegaTest, sl = FALSE)
```

This is what our factor structure would look like in a hierarchical fashion. We have the general factor (g) and our 5 subfactors (also called grouping factors). We can see how strongly our subfactors load onto our general factor with the provided values. We can also see how strongly each individual items loads onto a subfactor.

We can also look at some reliability values (and a cleaner loading matrix):

```{r}
omegaTest
```


While we see that we can get an $\alpha$ value, we also have Guttman's $\lambda_6$, and 3 different $\omega$ values that are of interest to us. Since we are dealing with something of a hierarchical nature, we already know that $\alpha$ and $\lambda_6$ won't be appropriate.  $\omega_h$ gives us an idea about the reliability of the general factor (perhaps not super in this case) and $\omega_t$ gives us the total reliability of the test (very good). 

We can also see item loadings for the general factor and each subfactor. Generally, we find that the items that we would anticipate loading together (e.g., all N items load together, and all O items load together), along with some cross-loading items from other subfactors.

## Item Response Theory And Factor Analysis

While we are still dealing in the world of latent variables, we are taking a new approach to measuring those latent variables -- Item Response Theory (IRT). While both allow us to measure a person's level of a latent trait, IRT gives us the power to understand the person and the items. We can recall that factor analysis falls under the broader heading of Classical Test Theory (CTT) -- the name is a clear indication that the focus is on the test as a whole, not individual items. 

In addition to this broadened understanding, IRT has a different focus from a measurement perspective than factor analysis. Perhaps most important is the notion of measurement error in IRT. In factor analysis, measurement error is assumed to be consistent across each item; this is not the case for IRT.

## Dichotomous And Polytomous Models

Before we dive into some of the more important parts of IRT, it is important to draw some distinctions between two broad families of models: dichotomous and polytomous. A dichotomous model can best be thought of in testing situations where a correct answer exists (you either get the question correct or not, so the outcome is dichotomous). With that knowledge, you might have already guessed what the polytomous model entails -- items that have ordered responses with no clear correct choices (Likert response options would be a good example). Polytomous models include such models as the graded response model and the partial credit model.

We will see how these models behave differently as we continue discussing the different parts of IRT models.

## Ability

In IRT, we talk about a person's ability; essentially it is the level of the latent variable that a person possesses. In the parlance of psychometrics, ability is denoted as $\theta$. The $\theta$ scale is standardized with a mean of 0 and tends to go from -4 to 4 (while this is generally seen, it might not always be the case). 

## Different Parameters

The ability to explore individual items within IRT is based upon three different parameters: location, discrimination, and psuedoguessing. We can incorporate any of those parameters into our model. First, though, we need to understand what those parameters mean.

### Location

In IRT, the location parameter (denoted as $\\b_i$) described the difficulty of the item. If we are talking about a testing situation (e.g., a math or science test), the meaning of $\\b_i$ is nearly self-evident -- it is simply the probability of a correct response to the question in a dichotomous model and the probability of moving from one category to another in polytomous models (the level of passing from one category to the next is called a *threshold*).

Let's look at some examples from the <span class="pack">mirt documentation of different item locations. The <span class="pack">ltm package is also a great package for IRT models.

```{r}
library(mirt)

library(ltm)

# The model arguement set to 1 means we are just looking
# at a one factor model.

fit1PL <- mirt(LSAT, model = 1, itemtype = "Rasch", verbose = FALSE)

plot(fit1PL, type = 'trace', which.items = 1:5, 
     facet_items = FALSE)

```


The resulting plot is what is known as an *Item Characteristic Curve*. It contains a lot of information, but we are only going to pay attention to the location right now. Without any prior knowledge, which of the labelled curves would say represents the most difficult item? If you said "3" (the black line), then you are absolutely correct. When we look at the location of an item in an ICC graph, we are looking for its placement along the x-axis around its middle point (i.e., find the middle of a curve and draw a line straight down -- the farther to the right, the more difficult the item). With item 3, we can see that it takes someone with slightly more than average ability to have a better than chance probability of responding correctly.  


### Discrimination

Item discrimination, the $a_i$ parameter, demonstrates the likelihood of people with varying degrees of ability to respond correctly.

Let's specify a slightly different model and take a look at our ICC again:

```{r}
fit2PL <- mirt(LSAT, model = 1, itemtype = "2PL", verbose = FALSE)

plot(fit2PL, type = 'trace', which.items = 1:5, 
     facet_items = FALSE)
```


In our last model, we saw that all of the items had the exact same curve -- this is no longer the case. If we pay attention to item 3 again, we see that a person with very low ability ($\theta = -4$) has nearly a probability of 0 to respond correctly, someone with average ability ($\theta = 0$) has around a 50-50 chance of responding correctly, and high ability people ($\theta = 4$) have nearly 100% chance of responding correctly. We would definitely say that item 3 discriminates between different ability levels pretty well (we will see if it is the most discriminating item later). Which item might not discriminate too well? Without doubt, you said item 1, and you would be correct. While people at lower ability levels have less chance of responding correctly to item 1, we can see that a probability of 1 is obtained pretty soon after crossing $\theta = 0$. So while item 1 may provide a bit of discrimination at the lower end of $\theta$, it does nothing when dealing average or more. This provides even more evidence as to why item 3 is such a good item -- it discriminates very well along every point of $\theta$

So, we have a pretty good idea that item 3 is the most difficult item and the most discriminating item. This, hopefully, provides a demonstration on why IRT models are so powerful -- we can compare individual items to people (on the same scales, no less).

### Guessing

The third parameter, $c_i$, is the psuedoguessing parameter. Even the blind squirrel finds a nut and $c_i$ accounts for this. Essentially, the guessing parameter offers a slight penalty for the chance of guessing a correct answer.


# Models And Parameters

## 1PL

Now that we know what our parameters mean, we can start putting them into models. The one parameter logistic model (1PL) only estimates item difficulty ($b_i$). It assumes that all items discriminate equally and that all items have the same guessing parameter. 

Although some minor differences, you will often see the 1PL and Rasch model used interchangibly.

## 2PL

The two parameter logistic model (2PL) adds the discrimination parameter, $a_i$, into the model.

## 3PL

The three parameter logistic model (3PL) adds in the guessing parameter, $c_i$. You might wonder how in the world a guessing parameter is added! If someone could guess the correct answer (think about a multiple choice test), would the probability of a correct answer ever be 0? I would think not. So, $c_i$ just includes a lower-bound asymtote. 

```{r}
fit3PL <- mirt(LSAT, model = 1, itemtype = "3PL", verbose = FALSE)

plot(fit3PL, type = 'trace', which.items = 1:5, 
     facet_items = FALSE)
```

If we compare the ICC plots we saw for the 1PL and 2PL earlier, we see a a significant difference between the lower asymptote.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))

plot(fit1PL, type = 'trace', which.items = 1:5, 
     facet_items = FALSE, main = "1PL")

plot(fit2PL, type = 'trace', which.items = 1:5, 
     facet_items = FALSE, main = "2PL")

plot(fit3PL, type = 'trace', which.items = 1:5, 
     facet_items = FALSE, main = "3PL")
```

While we see that the probability for a low ability individual obtaining a correct answer for item 3 is still very low, it has improved slightly.

With all of these parameters, the probability of a correct response can be expressed as follows: $$p_i(\theta) = c_i + \frac{1 - c_i}{1 + e^{-a_i(\theta - b_i)} }$$


# Scoring

Scoring in IRT models works a bit differently than scoring in CTT. 

An element common to both IRT and CTT is the *true score*, $true_{score} = observed_{score} + e$. The distinction rests in how they treat $e$ -- CTT assumes that error is the same for everyone and IRT allows for error to vary freely across people.

IRT scores also have the added benefit of using the item response functions in the computation of scores. 

We can see the factor scores returned from our model:

```{r}
facScores <- fscores(fit3PL)

head(facScores)

summary(facScores)

```

And let's see what scores from a factor analysis would look like compared to these scores:

```{r}
faScores <- psych::fa(LSAT, 1, rotate = "promax")$scores

summary(faScores)

cor(faScores, facScores)

plot(faScores, facScores)
```


We can see some very clear similarities and an undeniable correlation between our two different factor scores. While certainly similar, we can be pretty confident that our IRT scores are closer to *true scores*. 

We can also put those scores back into our data to see how they correlate with the other items:

```{r}
library(dplyr)

LSAT %>% 
  mutate(scores = facScores) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  GGally::ggcorr()
```

We can see that overall scores are most correlated with item 3, followed by item 2, and item 4. If we recall our ICC plot from above, this probably should not surprise us too much -- item 3 is definitely the best item, while items 1 and 5 don't look as nice.

## Different Measurement Levels

So far, we have discussed models that are largely dealing with dichotomous variables (largely incorrect and correct). These are aptly names dichotomous models. However, we know that not all measures have a binary response. If we have multiple response options (perhaps a Likert response option format), then we need to use a polytomous model. One common model is the Graded Response Model (GRM). 

The GRM is used with the express purpose of ordinal, polytomous response options.

Let's take a look:

```{r}
library(psych)

library(dplyr)

testData <- bfi %>% 
  dplyr::select(starts_with("C")) %>% 
  na.omit()

library(ggridges)
library(viridis)
library(ggplot2)

testData %>% 
  tidyr::gather(key = question, value = score) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(score, question, fill = ..x..)) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient() +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "B") +
  theme_minimal()


grmMod <- mirt(testData, model = 1, itemtype = "graded", verbose = FALSE)

coef(grmMod, simplify = TRUE, IRTpars = TRUE)

```

In our coefficient output, we see coefficients for each item (b1:b5). These coefficients detail the *thresholds* for moving from one response level to the next (we also see the discrimination value). 

Just like our dichotomous models, we can also see our item characteristic curves.

```{r, fig.height=9, fig.width=9}

plot(grmMod, type = 'trace', which.items = 1:5, 
     facet_items = TRUE, main = "GRM")
```

We can see that these are very different looking ICC plots then what we saw before. Remember, that we are dealing with different models here. Instead of the probabililty of incorrect or correct, we are now dealing with the probability of moving from one response category to the next. To that end, each item's ICC has a curve for each response option over ability. If we look at the ICC for C1, we can see that someone offering a response of 1 on the scale would have a higher probability of having a lower ability. Conversely, someone offering a response of 6 would have a higher probability of being high ability.
