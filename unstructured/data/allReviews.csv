"For starters, I spent nine long and personally fulfilling years at Cedar. The exposure, learning and opportunities provided were invaluable. Cedar provides its employees an opportunity to work across diverse industries and sectors, across its full practice offering and provides opportunity for travel and project work across multiple countries. It also grooms and provides exposure for client interaction at CEO and Board level. All of this truly broadens one's perspective and is immensely enriching and satisfying. Personally, I was provided an opportunity to execute projects across 15 countries over my nine years at Cedar and have gained knowledge, exposure and expertise across diverse sectors such as Energy, Manufacturing, Retail, Real Estate, Education, BFSI and Government to name just a few. Another very strong plus of Cedar is that one cannot ever be part of an organization that is as apolitical as Cedar is. One of the reasons is that employee growth and rewards are based on pure meritocracy in the organization. Also, Cedar has an open and transparent culture with everyone on first name basis and no barriers of communication across hierarchical levels. All in all a super place to work for those with a good mind and a passion for learning.","No negatives in particular. Like any other consulting firm, Cedar is not for those seeking a 9-5 job nor for those averse to travel.","Many ex-employees have gained tremendously from Cedar and have reached great heights in their professional careers.

"1. Dubai is a great city to live in2. Consultants learn a lot during their tenure at Cedar","1. Senior Management doesn't know how to run the firm, lead the employees and treat their employees2. A yelling manager is what they think it takes to get work done. They don't even know the meaning of the word 'respect'3. Most other consulting firms make their employees work hard and most of their employees don't mind it. Here, they make you work hard and treat you like dirt4. They lie, lie, lie and then they lie even more (to the client, employees and probably to their families as well5. They promise the client a consultant's full time on the job and make the consultant work on 3 or 4 such projects. Why? Please refer to point 46.Senior Management takes a time management session and the session starts 6 hours late!! Even trains in India do better than that7. They state that they don't fire anyone and they fired at least 2 consultants in the last 1 year. Not that firing is a crime, but why lie about it?8. After a four hour review of a document, most times they find 7 synonym changes to be done, 2 commas to be added and 4 full stops to be removed so as to meet the so-called 'standard format'. Adding anything valuable is not seen from senior management in most cases9. A document is reviewed by a manager and he changes everything about it. His manager reviews it and he changes everything again. At the end of all these reviews, it turns out sometimes that the original produced by the consultant has been the final output. All of the changes have been given so that they can show their 'value add'10. Most of the senior management have done their MBAs from relatively unknown colleges OR claim to have an MBA even though what they have done is not an MBA (Why? Did you forget to refer to point 4 above? They can't even change jobs and therefore the treatment of consultants as dirt (as they feel threatened)11. They compare themselves to top tier consulting firms and pay 1/3rd salaries. Half the top-tier consulting firms don't even know that this firm exists (so much for comparison)12. Bonuses are typically paid a few months late in order to make consultants stick with them for those many months. How cheap...13. Can someone please tell them that a 2 day Harvard course doesn't mean a Harvard MBA and not tell clients that they studied at Harvard. Some old fellow at Harvard might have a heart attack reading this line. May god bless his soul14.

Approx. 50% attrition rate, which the company tries to control by asking the employees to sign 1 year contract when they join (financial value attached)9. No operations or negligible presence outside Middle East10. Very poor project planning (the company tries to grab projects by committing short timelines, e.g. a project which would ideally take 10 months would be committed for 6-7 months and low price just to get the project, and then employees are overburdened to complete the project on time)11. Senior Management is very Rude12. The company saves money by asking the employees to join in India office and then they are usually assigned to Middle East projects (forever) with very poor daily allowance.

You get the benefits of a small company (ability to have an impact and influence company direction, accessible management) without the instability of bleeding edge startups that may go out of business anytime.

I find employees I interact with to be experienced and hardworking, and willing to help out in areas of their expertise. I have worked at a huge consulting firm, and at a huge software development firm. I like the ability in a small firm to take on a high level of responsibility, develop a business area, see it to fruition, and then keep improving it.The pros of a small firm are you get to do everything.","The cons of a small firm are you have to do everything. Hayes doesnt have huge support departments, so youll have one or two talented people helping you out but may need to do some legwork on your own.","Ive seen the management and infrastructure of Hayes evolve over the past 10 years as the firm has grown. The challenge is keeping the right level of management and support departments to support the staff and fuel growth, without creating too much overhead. Mostly I think Hayes has gotten it right. Id encourage mentoring managerial skills in all the top performers, with some organizational professional development.

"Nice people and fun atmosphere, you play some fun games.","The nice people and fun is not what I get paid for. It is straight up commission and in addition to that, even if a sale is made, there is still a window of time where if the sale is canceled a short time after that you dont get paid at all. That means all the hard work and walking and talking you do can go away just because a customer changed their mind.When I got the call from one of the admins to come in for an interview I asked is this a sales job? I want to make sure Im making money. She said starting pay is $30,000 That is if everything goes perfect and a sale is made every day. My advice, only take this job if sales is your thing and if this is something you deep down want to do. Otherwise, if you are looking for a steady pay job and really need to make money this is not for you. The only people really thriving are the ones at the top for as long as everyone underneath them are working hard and making sales they get paid no matter what, you are working for them!Yes you are trained and taught the 8 great work habits but even if you do everything correctly there is no guarantee. A fun atmosphere they conduct in the office is not how you get paid but how many people you sign up in the field.

The vast majority of the time you show up to vacant buildings or locked doors or the ""contact"" is not there. The client has no idea that you are coming. SMS does not pay your expenses so you are simply out the money for your time, car and gas. The clients have no knowledge of these so called appointments. SMS sets between 3 and 6 ""appointments"" for you each day and you will be lucky if 1 is actually there and very little chance they know why you are there or care to hear you out. This is all at your expense. They then mandate that you collect 10 business cards each day (cold calls) for which they use for telemarketing. You do not get paid for this activity. You only bear the expense and time for which you DO NOT GET PAID. They then require you to check in 4-5 times per day and have mandatory calls and sales reports during the week. They advertise this as a $100,000 opportunity but that is highly unlikely. The turnover is incredible. This is simply not a legitimate career opportunity.

"Although I have sincerely tried to think of something that would be a pro about this company I can't. If I HAD to choose something it would be the trainer...not the training.","This is a not a company that you can secure your future with through hard work and dedication. This is the most unprofessional and worst managed company I have ever worked for. I was skeptical when i was hired over the phone after a thirty minute conversation. The next red flag was when I was told that I had to pay my own way to training and I would be reimbursed after my first sale. Now I have been in sales for over twenty years so I have been very successful in this career choice because you can't last this long in sales unless you are very good at what you do. The recruiter promised quality leads that would be provided by outstanding telemarketers in the home office, I did not have to cold call, they didn't micro manage and that the leads have been qualified and willing to meet with me...didn't happen. The leads were trash, they call cold calling ""hybrid-ing"" lol and NOT ONE of the leads that they supplied wete never expecting me nor did they even know who SMS was...go figure. Now ""hybrid-ing"" is actually cold calling where YOU supply the leads to the telemarketers. The expectation is for the sales rep to qualify ten prospects per day, get the name of the decision maker, make copies of all those business cards and send them to the corporate office so the telemarketer can call and schedule an appointment. In all my years in sales that's what's called COLD CALLING. Why do I even need a telemarketer to make a phone call and try to schedule a meeting for me when I've already qualified the business and found out who the contact was?!?!!?! They also expect you to check in with your manager four or five times a day! That's called micro managing in my book. I could go on and on and about all the lies that were told to me but I digress. When I visited HQ in Buffalo Illinois there was a seedy undertone. Most of the managers looked like low budget mobsters with greasylooking hair and wearing cheap suits. When you go on the tour of the call center it looks like a boiler room...only cubicles with a desk and a phone. When you walk through the boiler room it's akin to being ""new meat"" in a prison. The call center people stare and whistle and say things like ""I'm going to get you and you're mine""...crazy. While in training I learned that SMS had changed its name three or four times (no wonder I couldn't find any information on them when i attempted to do research the company) and that the founder was involved in some scandal. The trainer gave some bull excuse why they did it but now I know why. Trust me. I could go on and on and on.

They are infamous for hurting the small business owner by charging them a high up fee for 3 days of work by their analysts. However, once they send a consultant to the company they start racking up huge hourly fees that in reality have little to no benefit to the business. They harass the owners of the business until they get money out of them for bad business advice that they can't connect to any real savings or benefit to the business. If the business owner refuses to pay they will squat on the premises of the business and stalk the business owner until the business owner becomes so frustrated that they will put the charges on a credit card to get them off their property. As a sales person I realized that no matter how good I was at selling in the end I did not want to be involved with an organization such as this and their business practices. I also realized that it was a good old boys club that was more like a popularity contest and less like a performance based organization. If you don't kiss up you won't get good appointments.

"I worked with some very sharp people that had great industry experience and understanding of how to deliver great engagements. The variety of engagements across multiple industries gives you experience in a matter of a few years that would take ten years or more in industry.Pay: The firm pays well and exit opportunities to director and executive level roles in industry are available.","The delivery objectives of various Principals (Partners) and Directors was widely skewed. Engagement Delivery: very inconsistent delivery practices going on between senior leaders, which only became more apparent after acquisition by PwC.Billable Hours: administrative items such as the recording of billable hours was widely skewed. It is unethical for Principals and Directors to direct teams to record 40 hours a week when you are putting in more than 12 hours everyday. Charge the client the proper amount or staff the team appropriately to keep hours capped at 40 per week. Principals and Directors need a course in engagement financial management so that they are not selling projects with no contingency for overruns due to higher levels of effort to deliver.Training: the firm needs to do a better job of coordinating the staffing of engagements with teams that can actually deliver the sold engagement. I can't count the amount of time wasted trying to convince a senior member of the team about why their idea will not work. There are times where a structured problem solving approach that looks great on paper is absolutely the wrong path to go down for that client given their capabilities. Deliver results that are actionable and meaningful for the client , which results in them becoming long term partners with the firm.","Eliminate Poor Leaders: when you start to have Principals and Directors who have such notorious reputations for being difficult to work with engagement after engagement, it may be time to have a sit down between the partners to address such behavior. Selling engagements is how the firm makes money, but if you have poor leaders who create such a toxic environment on their engagements that people flat out refuse to work with them in the future, including leaving the firm if push comes to shove, you have a serious morale and culture issue on hand. Deal with this dead wood and the morale will shoot through the roof.Culture: the senior leaders from legacy PRTM need to quit running rogue operations within PwC and assimilate to the new firm. The PwC culture seems to be very good and I think there is a great opportunity to merge best practices from both firms. It is not an overnight process, but one that will take time if you try. Your Senior Associates and Managers are not idiots and can see what is going on.

Management is excellent and has great communication with employees - I always felt like I knew what was going on in the business and what the strategic direction was for the firm.","My biggest drawback is the lack of name recognition. This is something that PRTM has been working on, but it can be very frustrating, both for selling work and for selling yourself (be it on a resume, with others, etc). For people who know the firm, PRTM always has a stellar, shining reputation and people are impressed to hear that you work there. However, most will not know the firm. Secondly, project staffing can be somewhat subjective. It takes a good deal of internal politics to ensure you are staffed on the types of projects you want to work on.","Involve lower levels in the staffing project and ramp up campus recruting to help with name recognition.","4.0","PRTM Management"
"PRTM is full of extremely intelligent people that do a good job leveraging their technical background and expertise in a way that drives results for clients delivering a solid impact on their bottom line. At PRTM you will build deep practice and industry knowledge, skills, and capabilities faster than you would in any other work environment.You will also find a much more collegial work environment than you would at any of its strategy consulting competitors since a core tenet of the culture is to eliminate the words ""I"" and ""me,"" replacing them with ""we"" and ""us.""","The biggest downside with PRTM is that despite the depth of it's consulting experience, client successes, and capabilities it doesn't have the same brand recognition as its major strategy consulting competitors. Leadership is aggressively attempting to change this, but it is an uphill battle.Also, PRTM is a fiscally conservative organization and this is evident through it's mediocre compensation levels. This approach has helped it to thrive despite times of economic turbulence, but has also limited its ability to improve its brand positioning.","Maintain focus on improving PRTM's brand positioning.

"Please note that I have no experience with AMC alone.Instead, I work under a mix of both AMC and Acacia Capital. A mash up of two different management companies.

They charge up the apartments far past the market average without consideration for the age or condition of the property. This puts a lot of stress on the on-site staff.Additionally, the bonus structure is dependent upon far too many factors. Commissions are reduced for any reason. You expect $50 for each move-in but you're left with $15 if they don't move-in almost immediately. You expect a $1,500 quarterly bonus but you're left with $500 if you go a cent over any of your budget line items.Upper management would rather force an applicant in to an apartment in order to increase occupancy without any concern for their 'preferred' move-in date. Leaving the applicant feeling pressured and unhappy.It is without question that little to no money is put back in to the property. Our budgets are shallow and prevent flexibility.

"Used to be a great place to work for.","Since the takeover through Infosys a few year back, the company has lost its way and become just an extended arm of the mega-outsourcing behemoth that is Infosys. In fact, the name ""Lodestone"" is already gone, and the company is now only called ""Infosys Consulting"".When I joined, I asked whether the culture would change from its European roots, and the partner said that the consulting branch would always be treated differently from the main AMS and Development departments. Well, that partner is now gone, together with most of the other good people that used to work there. Most of the former Lodestone senior leadership is gone, too. Administration and IT was successively moved to India, with disastrous results for productivity and efficiency of basic functions like invoicing and timesheet management. Bit by bit, ridiculous kindergarten rules were introduced with regards to procedures and processes. Those may be required to keep fresh-grads in India under control but are totally useless and insulting to senior consulting staff. Finally, performance reviews were slowly changed towards rewarding the ""appearance of effort"" (such as spending long times in the office or doing cherry-picked jobs for the boss instead of real project work or helping colleagues). That means that even if you worked off your butt for a client, you might just end up in the middle of the bell curve and score an ""average"" final performance result, with accordingly negative effects on your bonus and promotion chances.Conclusion: If you like micromanagement, byzantine processes, inefficiencies, and cronyism, this might be a good place to work at now. But if you were looking for management and IT consulting excellence, a relaxed European mindset that rewards responsibility and client-focused work, stay away. Speaking to people who have recently left or are still working there, morale among ex-Lodestone folks has slowly reached rock bottom.","Return to the roots of what made Lodestone a globally successful company and respected name.

"- Ability to work with marquee clients (think large brand names, such as investment banks in Singapore- Pay structure on par with (touted to be better than) comparable positions across the Big-4, IF you are Caucasian or possess a degree from the more prestigious universities in the West- Occasional networking opportunities- Work-life balance in some projects- though this stems from the fact that most projects are technology delivery ones- Long 'bench' period for (permanent) employees not staffed on projects by any standards. Employees are known to have been paid salaries simply for reporting to work, while being unstaffed on any project, for as many as 13 months- Skewed foreigner-local employee ratio. This is a 'pro' considering that most IT talent originates from India; locals are relegated to admin/staff positions","- The Asian office (Singapore/HK) is a glorified 'bodyshop'. Most projects do not come anywhere close to the definition of a 'consulting' engagement- As a result, most staff AKA 'consultants' are hired on the basis of their technical experience notwithstanding their deplorable people-management skills. Many come from no-name institutions across the West, which is justifiable in that more talented employees are likely to pass over this firm- Sub-optimal performance levels given that most employees are only in a limbo state awaiting their next gig- As with all tier-2/tier-3 consulting firms, unethical decisions are rife (and celebrated) so long as they translate to higher client revenue- Pay scales, by title/rank, are alleged to be wide. Expect to be paid at the lower end of the scale if you are not Caucasian- Inverted pyramid structure. Overcrowded at Principal/Senior Principal levels with few revenue streams. Unsustainable- The Singapore office thrives solely on a couple of projects in the financial services industry. Clients are able to see through the extent of value-addition promised vis-a-vis romantic expectations set and are scaling down their projects- Minimal opportunities for training and development- Advancement up the career ladder highly political and not meritocratic- The HR's capabilities do not seem to extend beyond hiring/firing candidates. It's no surprise that the firm exudes an image of a staffing firm vis-a-vis a consulting outfit","To say that a lot of work is to be done would be an understatement.

The account managers always receive their commissions and that is the end of it. Commissions and bonuses for everyone else either are threatened to be withheld or are withheld for one reason or another and the reasons are usually fabricated. Expectations change from one week to the next and many employees' goals are a moving target so you never know what each week will bring as far as expectations and punishment for not meeting them.

The only pro I would add is holiday party with open bar where everyone likes to get drunk, not feel the pain of working in this company and smile.","The cons are a mile long but here are few:1. ZERO work-life balance: Everyone in services department ends up work minimum of 12 hours a day with few working till midnight.2. Management only cares for utilization: Management has been pushing for certain amount of utilization which is not practical for 95% of the employees, rest 5% achieve while working on projects in Europe and become the star of services team. Due to this every employee ends up losing yearly bonus which has been a joke for last few years.3. Bad salary: Janitor of the building where headquarter is located has a better annual income than Implementation consultants(IC) even after working less hours. Management comes up with a bluff of a plan once in a while to increase salary to market rate but it never happens. Everyone in our department is paid a salary from 80's with promotion plan as a joke and annual salary hike which would only makes us ashamed of yourself.4. Yearly bonus- Management makes you work hard throughout the year on a promise of 10% annual performance bonus but ends up paying no more than half of it because they are bunch of thief's and like to steal from its own employees.5. High turnover- In just one year 10+ Tech ICs/ICs and 4 Sr.ICs have left EtQ. This has become a trend and talented people who had been here for 5+ years are leaving after being sick and tired of work culture at EtQ.6. No respect for employees or their ideas- Individual views dont matter at EtQ. Voices and concerns are heard, plans are made but no action is ever taken. Owners of this company are talented orators who cannot walk the talk. Not even a single services employee has any motivation left to work in this company and aggressively looking for better job opportunities.","No point in giving advice to sr. management on this website as they would never understand the meaning of invest in employees.

The work was interesting, the pay was great, and there always seemed to be free food some where.","While the work was intersting, there wasn't much of it so there were a lot of slow days. But the worst part was my sudden termination. I was called into a meeting by my manager, who was not even in the office. I met with HR in a conference room and my manager let me go over the phone. No warnings were ever given prior to this meeting. I was never put on any sort of corrective action, and when asked, no specfic details were given as to the reason behind this decision, which tends to make me believe it wasn't his decision, but rather someone in upper management. This happened on a Monday, and I wasn't even allowed to finish the week. It was a huge slap in the face by people I was starting to trust. My warning for anyone considering working for this company, be prepared for your job to end any day without reason or notice, as this was what happened to me. Maybe this is something they will change, but right now, it left me extremely dissatisfied with this company.","If you're planning on terminating someone's career, have the decency to let them know that their job is in jeopardy so that they have the chance to improve. And, if you ultimately reach the decision to end their career, be professional enough to do it in person, instead of waiting until you're out of the office so you can hide behind the phone.

"ECG is a rapidly growing firm with tremendous market opportunities. Although the firm has many competencies on the provider side of healthcare, there are many untapped areas where ambitious associates can build a practice area. The firm promotes an entrepreneurial culture that, when managed appropriately, leads to great innovation and immense satisfaction among its associates.Individuals who can push through the late nights and days on the road are rewarded at the upper levels with generous bonus plans that reward the hungry and ambitious. Staff are treated well with in-office meals, fully stocked refrigerators and snacks, private offices, and social opportunities.Talent at the firm is top-notch. This is no place for individuals who like to be comfortable. You are usually surrounded by the best and the brightest. Someone is always pushing to get further than previously reached. That keeps smart individuals on their toes but sharp elbows can also hinder progress of others.","Rapid growth has eroded the traditional culture of the firm which may not be an overall negative. The firm has nearly doubled in the last two years, largely through a series of acquisitions and strategic senior hires. Much focus has been placed on these individuals and groups who have brought considerable but narrow expertise in specific practice areas. The addition of so many outside leaders without corresponding junior staff have led to a top-heavy structure.The delivery model has changed from a regional/generalist one to a national/specialist structure and a number of senior staff have been caught in the transition as reporting relationships and client focuses are shuffled. Some have benefitted while other have found themselves fighting to regain position or find a new area of focus.The continued insistence on an office-based culture that is becoming increasingly irrelevant is frustrating to some. Many beautiful offices sit relatively empty throughout the week as project managers and project officers travel or live away from office locations. This leaves junior staff often working alone in a quiet lonely office for days at a time.

"Every individual at the firm produces excellent work, from the smallest internal work product to massive client deliverables. There is strong focus on quality of deliverables for both content and design, with consultants expected to create diverse, visually appealing deliverables efficiently. Peers and managers often provide a reference to an expert within the firm for content areas where a consultant may not be comfortable working alone. Every individual is passionate about their work and engagements are typically interesting and innovative.","ECG was successful in increasing its size over the recent years, but the management did not anticipate and proactively grow administrative support in kind. The firm only brought on a CFO and CHRO at a point where the organization had almost 200 consultants, leading to policies that were confusing for both existing and new staff members. The firm boasts about its entrepreneurial spirit, but the focus on office-based consulting is dated and dis-incentivizes younger employees. Office-based consulting doesn't foster collegiality in small locations where there may only by 15 consultants and 75% of the office is traveling. Firm culture is confusing - legacy/lifelong ECG managers seem to have different expectations for social interactions and those expectations vary wildly between offices. Senior leadership does communicate the need to work over 40 hours, with a goal of 40 billable hours per week. However, work commitment expectations vary between senior managers, so setting personal boundaries to try and stabilize work-life balance is impossible for new employees. Consultants do not consistently work with the same project teams and are expected to adjust to new management styles without much support. Much lip service is paid to professional development but it is difficult to guarantee face-to-face time with administrative managers. It is hard to maintain motivation and remain engaged when backlog hours fluctuate and management is inaccessible.","The new Consultant Development Lead will hopefully correct the quality and consistency of professional development support. Employee communications should be clearer - even the new meeting structure is confusing with regards to attendance expectations. Continued attention to appropriately addressing the company's expansion is necessary to retain and motivate the expert staff at ECG.","3.0","ECG Management Consultants"

A few things that they just don't seem to get:- Most of the work can be done remotely, yet they insist on office presence for the sake of it. Everyone is expected to work nights and weekends, proving that the work can be done anywhere, yet people have to be in seats at certain times of the day in low energy office locations. Many of these are often in undesirable and difficult to access parts of the metropolitan area.- Virtually no transparency is given to the criteria for promotion.- Staff consultants have no quarterly or even annual financial incentives to perform above and beyond expectations. Management seems to be content with a docile workforce that slogs along trying to avoid negative feedback and that is the extend of their incentive structure.- Social interaction and energy levels within the office are lacking tremendously. Management has expected this to occur organically through affinity group development where groups organize around specific interest areas, but management invests little to actively cultivate this.- Adoption of technology is excruciatingly slow. Office instant messaging was adopted just as that technology became obsolete. Can you imagine if they implemented something like Slack? Don't bet on it.","Put some serious effort into financially rewarding performance at all levels and not just the senior manager level.Invest in leading edge communication technologies even if there is some potential risk involved.Catch up with the times on remote working arrangements, and stop discouraging or shaming individuals who are more productive when they are not shackled to a desk.","1.0","ECG Management Consultants"

Everyone is extremely intelligent and passionate about their work. Projects are typically interesting, complicated, and leading edge in terms of the industry.Opportunities for promotion are significant.","ECG is an historically small firm and has had trouble scaling in recent years to a large firm with multiple locations, broad services, and limited culture. There is very little HR support in terms of the annual review process and promotion criteria differ significantly from manager to manager. Work life balance is limited at best with client deadlines pushed to the forefront and often poor planning leads to weekend work sessions and all night deliverable preparation.Travel can be significant (Mon-Thur) for months at a time in some cases but more typically this job is a lonely desk job in a private office where office socializing is discouraged in favor of billing time.Culture is poorly defined and lags behind similar firms in terms of team building, trust, and transparent promotion process. Instead of one company with a strong central culture the feeling among employees is more of individuals working on individual projects with random levels of oversight and limited collaboration. ECG does a poor job of developing ""4 star"" talent into 5 star talent. In other words, individuals that would succeed anywhere do well at ECG but anyone that might be a 5 star with a little development rarely receives the development they need and typically leave.","Simply, the culture of the organization is not set up to allow for the scaling planned.My advice would be to invest in culture building outside of traditional methods (summer conference, occasional social events). Instead, backlog professional develop hours for office lunches, mentoring, etc. and create a culture that discourages employees from working during these sessions. Right now, the culture set by leadership is one that expects consultants to work during all division meetings, late nights, and weekends all in the interest of client work, even if formal announcements say otherwise. This culture will not scale or retain talent.Invest in knowledge sharing and the development of consultants with targeted training and formal mentoring sessions with leaders across the firm. Enforce consistent management processes across all practices and managers and increase HR function to bring formality and professionalism to the people planning strategy.","4.0","ECG Management Consultants"

"I have really enjoyed my first few months at CIL. For me the best thing about working here is the people. CIL is a comfortable and enjoyable environment to work in. From initial training and through my first few projects everyone has been incredibly friendly and welcoming. I enjoy working in a company with no hierarchy, we all work in an open plan office, the partners work on the desks next to us, they are approachable and friendly.The short projects we complete keeps the work interesting and challenging. Completing projects in multiple sectors allows me to gain an in depth understanding in a diverse variety of sectors. Every day and every project is different, I am constantly learning new skills, speaking to new people and completing different tasks.I have thoroughly enjoyed my first few months working at CIL. I think the company is a great place to start my career and will give me many opportunities in the years to come.","As with most consultancy firms, the hours we work are unpredictable. They differ dependent on the project and how tight a deadline is. However, if we start to work longer hours we are given the time back. I was doubtful about this but in my first couple of months have been given both half and full days off once projects are completed. There are few consultancies I know who offer this to staff and actually stick to it. Its nice to work for a company who appreciate the hard work we do.",,"4.0","CIL Management Consultants"
"The nature of projects, being generally short in time-frame, mean you develop really quickly. After initial training, you are constantly learning as you work and there is a great culture of colleagues helping each other. Work is interesting and varied, and projects span a breadth of sectors. Management are very accommodating if you express a particular interest in trying something out, and being a smaller company, there is also an opportunity to get involved in some more operational areas if interested.","Hours can occasionally be unpredictable, but there isn't really a culture of working long hours for the sake of it, which is good.",,"5.0","CIL Management Consultants"
"Firstly, the company culture and the people are fantastic - it is unlike anywhere else that I have worked. The work is interesting and varied (typical projects last about 5 weeks) and everyone is incredibly smart. CIL has been the continuous learning curved that I had hoped it would be.Secondly, the Frome office is ideal for me - it gives me the chance to live in the countryside around Bath and still work a London-style job. I was slightly apprehensive about leaving London at first, but I frequently work from the London office and travel up for client meetings. This provides the balance that I enjoy and I am unaware of any other consultancies that provide a similar opportunity.","Like any consultancy, the hours can be long and unpredictable, but CIL will give you a day or two off after a gruelling project. From time to time you may work on a project / in an industry that you do not find very interesting, but it comes with the territory.",,"5.0","CIL Management Consultants"
"CIL has a great company culture. Almost everyone has a nickname and people address each other as such. Coming in as an intern, I was really insecure and was afraid that I would feel suffocated at the bottom of the hierarchy. But CIL isn't like that at all! Everyone is really loving and helpful. It's not just that when you go to them for help, they will help you. People literally rush to you and check whether you are dealing ok or if you need any help.I've interned with other companies before. I feel that with many other companies, it's difficult to fit in as a new-comer because everyone knows each other's stories and/or histories and it's almost rude to break in by asking. And when those topics come up, you just feel so uninvolved and it's almost like you don't exist. But in CIL, whenever an inside joke comes up, people always remember that you exist and would always explain to you what happened. It's thoughtful details like this that make me feel 'loved' in this company (it's weird to use such a word in a corporate setting but it's true).","It's not a big consultancy name like McKinsey so if you tell your parents where you work, they may not know. But it's definitely a rising star.",,"5.0","CIL Management Consultants"
"The work is interesting and varied - projects are typically ~1 month, meaning you gain exposure to a wide range of businesses and industries in a relatively short space of time. You are given a lot of responsibility from your very first project. Senior management are great - very visible and approachable and brilliant to learn from; and the whole company is very transparent in terms of how it's run and what's going on.The office vibe is what has struck me most in my first few months - everyone has a sense of both humour and humility. Everyone works hard in this industry, regardless of employer, but the CIL offices feel very relaxed and everyone manages to remain nice to each other, even when working to (our usual) tight deadlines!","It can be hard to plan a weeknight social life due to the unpredictable nature of our work. We don't regularly work really late, but when we do we often won't know about it until the day before, which can be frustrating. A more formal structure in place to support this would be much appreciated. This is an industry-wide problem, however the shorter project lengths may exacerbate this.","Continue to be proactive about improving our ability to plan work-life balance in advance and keep focused on maintaining both the culture and the amount of direct contact between the most junior and senior people in the firm as we keep growing.","5.0","CIL Management Consultants"
"Great opportunities for learning - deal-based short-term projects (mostly less than one month) means exposure to a large variety of sectors and business problems, smaller consultancy means a lot of exposure to partners and clients. Good in-house and external training sessions. Intelligent and competent senior staff to learn from.Friendly culture - there is a friendly and sociable environment in the office, and social events outside the office","Unpredictable hours - you often might not know in advance whether you will have to work late, which can make it difficult to schedule your social life. This is to some extent the name of the game in consulting, and I do not think CIL is worse than its peers in this respect, but it could still be managed better.Limited input on staffing - you might not be put on projects which you feel are most interesting or would most further your career. Again, this is not unique to CIL, but can be frustrating regardless.","Be careful to maintain the culture. As the company grows and some existing staff leaves to pursue new opportunities this might prove tricky. Also take care when having to rely on freelancers.","5.0","CIL Management Consultants"
"I recently joined CIL as a graduate analyst and have definitely found the interesting work, early responsibility and friendly environment that I was looking for. My experience of the application process was very positive; I was assigned a mentor who answered all my questions and I met a broad range of employees during the three rounds of interviews. Upon joining CIL, I received two weeks of training and then was put straight onto projects. The small size of teams (3-5 people) means that I have been involved in all aspects of projects and their short length (4-6 weeks) means that I have already worked across a diverse range of industries. The people are intelligent and supportive, and I was immediately welcomed as part of the team.","The hours can be demanding, particularly towards the end of a project. This is something that the company addresses through allocating rest days and organising social events following busy deadline periods.",,"5.0","CIL Management Consultants"
"CIL is a really good place to start your career. As a smaller consultancy, you get more exposure to senior clients and more early responsibility.

The people also make it a very enjoyable place to work.","The one downside is the long hours. This can vary from project to project but at some point is unpredictable and unavoidable.

"FMC is a company made up of a group of driven and inspired people determined to not only make a success of the business, but make a success of each individual they hire. Alongside a competitive salary, there are numerous benefits and opportunities that come with working at FMC; training and development, bonuses, childcare vouchers, healthcare, company trips, fitness challenges and huge Christmas parties. My personal favourite activities have been completing Tough Mudder, climbing Snowdon and taking over a country manor for the mother of all house parties.My 3.5 years at FMC were incredibly positive; I moved from the recruitment team (8 months) into the marketing dept where I spent the remainder of my time. I was offered a lot of support during the transition, given 1-2-1 training with our systems providers and had regular meetings with my MD and manager. I was given the freedom to work on my own projects, could always ask for help when I needed it and always felt encouraged to do my best and given pep-talks when I lacked confidence, felt frustrated or had a lazy period. During periods where I would clash with my manager, we would resolve things in the boardroom and create plans of how to better work together, resulting in a strong team dynamic. Yes, in a sales environment there are KPI's and targets to meet, and if you fall below target you will be monitored, but you will be supported and get the help you need and ask for. The difference with FMC is that if you show willing, you will be given a chance to turn things around, for a much longer period than most companies would entertain.At FMC, you will find;- An informal, yet professional culture where you don't have to leave your personality at the door.- A team that works with professional integrity.- Positive reinforcement, training and development where needed.- Modern offices- An open-door whether you need help with your work, your specialism, or your personal life.- A team of really friendly, dynamic people who support each other, live together and socialise together giving the office a friendly/family environment. They celebrate each others successes, go to each others weddings and rally through difficult times. This is a very unique set of people who were wonderful to work with.- A Management Team and MD who genuinely care for your well-being, get to know you personally and understand how to help you with your weakness and build up your strengths.- Experienced professionals with specialised (and international) markets willing to teach you and develop you.- A professional ladder that is quick and easy to climb if you are willing to put the work in...graduates have been promoted to Account Managers in less than a year!During my time at FMC I had a great group of friends to work with, felt incredibly supported in pursuing my career goals and still maintain the positive relationships I built.","It's hard to think of cons, sometimes parking is a little tricky and sales/ target driven environments aren't for everyone.Overall FMC were fantastic to work for and I would return in a heart beat.",,"5.0","Fairfax Management Consultants"

"-Ultimately what is the best about CAST is the people. Everyone you meet is sharp, supportive and generally fun to be around which in my opinion leads to the success of the firm. While management consulting does have a reputation for being stressful, being around your coworkers at CAST consistently makes it worthwhile.-Exposure to senior level leadership from Day 1, there will usually be a partner directly involved in daily project operations-Responsibility available for those that want it. Since CAST is a smaller firm, the opportunity to take initiative and show what you are strong at from the beginning is incredibly valuable. Also, comparing to other firms where the promotion timeline is very structured and based on tenure, those that perform well at CAST can have an accelerated series of promotions.-Senior leadership that listens and is willing to change parts of the organization that need improvement. As an example, CAST recently implemented a volunteer program to allow employees to take paid time off to volunteer for organizations of their choosing.","-As with consulting as a whole, the work/life balance can be a struggle with travel and sometimes unpredictable hours. The workload never was overwhelming with CAST, but I think I struggled with getting my feet on the ground outside of work at times.-Since CAST is based in Los Angeles, junior level resources are expected to work out of LA. This isn't an issue for those that want to live in the area, but the flexibility of larger firms when it comes to location can be more attractive for some.","-continue to listen to your employees across all levels, we give feedback because we want you to read and respond-continue to hire top tier talent while also focusing on the CAST fit. While larger firms have some benefits, the people at CAST will always be the biggest selling point for me. I encourage you to keep developing that culture and family you have worked so hard to create.","5.0","CAST Management Consultants"
"Flat structure makes it easy to work with senior level resources and get opportunities beyond your tenure","You'll be asked a lot from day 1 - challenging environment but great place to learn","The culture is the strongest thing for CAST and keeps it a valuable place to learn - don't let that slip!","4.0","CAST Management Consultants"
"I have been working at CAST Management Consultants for over 4 yearsSince joining, CAST has provided me opportunities to be creative in my work, get involved in various internal initiatives, and work directly with Partners. On any given project, I find myself interacting directly with senior leadership. CAST provides its employees with the opportunity to engage with clients at a more senior level than at other consulting firms. Overall, CAST places a strong level of trust in its employees. The culture at CAST is also a strong selling point. An important part of the CAST culture is a commitment to providing new Associates with a strong support network. People enjoy coming into the office on Friday's, after travelling all week, to catch up with everyone in person.","Throughout the year, travel can fluctuate from every week to not at all. CAST attempts to accommodate everyone's preference, but as a boutique firm, this is not always possible. There is a two-week ""boot camp"" for new employees which is great, but CAST does not offer any additional follow-up training.","Continue to provide staff with opportunities to work on projects in different practice areas. Provide training seminars throughout the year to allow staff to continue to grow their skill sets.","5.0","CAST Management Consultants"
"Ive been with CAST for over 5 years and am delighted that CAST is entering a growth cycle on the back of new service offerings and an energized partnership. The team here has been resilient throughout the aftershocks of the Global Financial Meltdown, and is looking to begin expanding again to support a growing project pipeline. The workforce is growing primarily from the ranks of the Associate Consultant development program, where I started out. The program is a real strength for CAST, with a focus on rapid development and no ceiling for entry level employees  people have advanced from Associate all the way up through Partner in CASTs 28 year history.New Associates start together as one class and go through CASTs boot camp to learn the hard skills and soft skills of consulting directly from experienced staff. In terms of professional development beyond boot camp, the firm has a high ratio of partners to staff, creating an environment that exposes new hires immediately to the partners knowledge and experience at a rate that is hard to match for consulting firms of this size.","The firm is small enough (35 consulting staff) that the project pipeline dictates what projects you will be staffed on, sometimes without much room for personal preferences. Not typically an issue as the firm will sell a wide variety of work, but occasionally projects of specific types will pile up and the whole firm will be dedicated to one particular service offering  an issue if your preferences are elsewhere.Projects tend to be spread out across the country, so it can be hard at times to stay in close contact with the firm beyond your immediate project team as you travel week-to-week.","Continue to invest in new service offerings that are exciting to staff and make CAST a dynamic place to work.","5.0","CAST Management Consultants"
"CAST is a great option for those wanting a management consulting experience in a smaller setting. The firm has recruited well in the past, assembling a smart team that cares about providing quality results. The culture has come a long way, providing a flexible work environment for junior resources. Advancement comes to those who work hard and prioritize the firm's goals.","As with any consulting firm, experience can be highly dependent on project staffing. Additionally, travel can range from 0% to 100% - either scenario can be a pro or con depending on personal preferences. The lack of name brand recognition is challenging when contemplating exit opportunities, though alumni have landed impressive roles.","Recent management changes are very positive, with a focus on growing the firm. Your willingness to listen and react to employee concerns is appreciated.","5.0","CAST Management Consultants"
"High level of integrity among the firm's leadership, great collaborative culture, younger employees frequently given responsibility and autonomy to prove themselves, capable and committed colleagues top-to-bottom, entrepreneurial energy and need to prove itself as a great small firm drives its high-quality delivery. big emphasis on execution and adding real value (as opposed to nebulous strategy development)","Pay is less than industry average as an Associate (but gets more competitive with experience), different project managers commit to project plans to different degrees (i.e., inefficiencies/rush orders occur), expect to be on-call most of the time (especially during projects)",,"5.0","CAST Management Consultants"
"Fairly flat organizational structure. Seemingly good opportunities to advance, take on greater responsibility, and influence the bottom line.","Most of what you come to expect from the interview turns out to be a mirage.

Proceed with caution - and make sure to get everything in writing.","Be true to your word. Honor bonuses and severances that have been committed.

"It was a pleasant winter morning & I stepped in Sathguru on 11th Dec,1991 as an office assistant.Wow!! 25 years at Sathguru has been an incredible journey. It is a reflective moment. I was young, energetic and full of great expectations. The management gave me my first break with an opportunity for working in the accounts department as an Accountant & after that I have been climbing up every step of my career.Back then we were barely 25 employees, 20 of us were bachelors and we worked together day and night as a family & friends & not as employees.Before joining Sathguru, I have never seen a computer & was not even comfortable speaking in English.Thanks to the emphasis on continuous learning & training at Sathguru, now I am not only an expert with my computer but also technically sound in my area of work & my communication skills.I never dreamt of seeing an aero plane. In Sathguru I was given plenty of opportunities.My first flight journey was to New Delhi in 2005 to visit Bangladesh embassy.My first International trip was to Cornell University, Ithaca and New York was in 2010 for meeting on project finance planning. This helped me in improving my skills in International accounting and the intricacies of project finance planning.And followed were many more trips like Singapore, Sydney, Australia for various workshops & to Sathguru SUMMER OFFICE with family ..The management continuously recognized my sincerity & hard work and kept rewarding and motivating me. Over the years I have won multiple awards & few to mention are:      Best performance award in 2012-13 & 2016 -17      Long service award in 2015 along with ten other colleges who completed 10 yearsThere are plenty of events & activities at Sathguru & I participate in every activity to balance my work life.I have also been able to share miles of smiles with my family at home & my parents at my village.I have seen the company grow and at every step the management supported every one of us to grow with the company.For me even after 25 years, every day is a fresh start and a new learning.

"Clean offices, top-notch technology, conveniently located for where I lived at the time. Non-executive colleagues were professional and supported each other well. Executive staff is personable.","Lack of leadership from the top executives results in dysfunctional workplace environment. Company has no strategic plan, no business development plans and no structure for growth or sustainability. Hiring and firing occurs at whiplash speed with no explanation given to staff. Continual restructuring and resistributing of executive responsibilities leads to confusion -- support staff is constantly having to report to different managers at different times. For a management and training company they have a remarkably unenlightened view on training their own staff. Leadership places new hires and personnel in management positions with no training or relevant experience related to the position. Virtually every employee has, at one time or another, been handed the baton for ""business development"" and not a single one of them had/has any background or experience in that area. Support staff is often given the responsibility for securing new business, managing and writing proposals and structuring management solutions without the necessary authority or experience. Staff is often expected to burden repsonsibilities far above their paygrade, picking up the slack left by the executive team.Support and non-supervisory staff do have experience with proposal writing, proposal management, contract management, budget management and pricing. However, executive staff disregards this experience and continues to employ the same losing strategies upon which they have always relied. Company mantra is ""if it hasn't worked so far, just keep hitting your head against that wall until it caves.""Ridiculous amount of administration required to complete simple tasks. COO's coordinator is working out of Alabama, so all tasks have to be routed through him/her before getting to anyone else in the office. All staff responses also have to be routed to Alabama before proceeding. Proposals are monitored out of Alabama while all the actual work (writing, managing, editing, researching) is completed in Dumfries by the non-management staff. Still all pieces of the proposals are sent to Alabama and then forwarded to your colleague across the hall for changes, edits, etc.","Get some training for your staff. Attend management and executive-level training courses yourselves. Hire a CEO who lives in the area and who has some management experience outside the military. Hire a COO who stays in the office beyond 3pm or better yet, one that actually works in the office rather than ""from home.""

No pipeline and hires and fires personnel as the wind changes. Places employee in positions ill-suited to their talents and experience or assigns them tasks outside their job description with no training. Usually places a heavy burden of responsibility for company success on one person, drains them and then replaces them.","Take some management and business classes. Cut your overhead.

"When I first interviewed for RJMC / STEP STRATEGY and saw the Glassdoor Reviews, I wrongfully doubted the value of the summer internship program. However, after spending a summer with RJMC / STEP STRATEGY,, I cannot thank Sharona and the team enough. As a University of Virginia student, I came into the program with some experience in a Series B start-up, but no management consulting experience. To my surprise, I was placed in a beautiful open office overlooking a mountain range in Brentwood, one of the most affluent neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California. On one of my first days I was taken on site to a credit retailer with over $600 million in annual revenue and worked with the principals on a systems analysis of the accounting, merchandising, floor planning, and customer relations systems. The office runs quite like a start-up company. Each intern comes from some of the most elite schools in the country and brings a unique perspective and network to the program. I had the privilege to pitch my own ideas to the principals of the firm, who have high profile connections to top CEOs in Los Angeles and Israel. When my ideas were determined valuable, I was given the freedom to work on my own projects throughout the summer, culminating in an event in August where we met C-Suite management in cutting edge virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming, entertainment, ad-tech, venture capital, angel investing, production, cybersecurity, and technology firms. Whether a high-growth start-up in Silicon Beach that just closed a $60M funding round or a billion-dollar established enterprise, I saw first-hand how Sharona commands the respect and admiration of power players in business. We even got to meet Yossi Vardi, the Godfather of Israels hi-tech industry, which is now the second start-up ecosystem in the world with $2.8 billion invested in the first half of 2016 next to Silicon Valley. Yes, Sharona has high expectations for the work you deliver but these expectations were only to help the interns develop as professionals. I believe that the previous Glassdoor reviewers just may not have the ability to take constructive criticism and use it to inspire better work habits. Each day we have access to a kitchen filled with snacks and drinks. In fact, we either all go out for free lunch or order free lunch to the office, where we discuss recent M&A activity and business news over a meal. Bottom line is I appreciate Sharona for developing me professionally and turning an amateur management consultant to an analyst with contacts throughout the business world and experience with multi-million dollar clients. I would even recommend the program over a more well-known firm because the ability to work intimately with experienced PwC principals gave me more experience and access than I would have as just another intern at the bottom of the totem pole in a bigger firm.","The need to adapt to constructive criticism.","Keep hiring high power interns.","5.0","RJMC"

"If you want to work in Management Consulting at a company that delivers high class, high impact work and respects private life then Syngroup is a great place for you. The management recognizes the stresses (travel, long hours, stress) that you face as a consultant and tries to mitigate these where possible. This is reflected in the high employee retention rate.

You will usually get client exposure and responsibility fairly quickly and you also have very knowledgeable mentors by your side for guidance.The atmosphere within the company is great.

"- Good work life balance compared to other consulting firms- Nice and communicative colleagues who like to help- Nice office facilities","- A lot of micromanagement is done by superiors instead of seeing the big picture- Very low level work without any intellectual challenges (same methods applied at every customers)- No (positive) feedback culture (feedback is only given one way and months after something happened)- No meaningful support or education possibilities for senior people- Poor people management (high fluctuation of people)- Management lacks significant people skills (no active communication, no transparency, only top down decisions)- No high ambitions to the quality of work- Very frugal culture (poor IT infrastructure, poor quality of notebooks, nuts in the office are limited, no fruit juices, etc.,   no to little money for sport activities, no money for networking events or marketing activities)- Staffing is done instranparently and very short term (sometimes only 24h notice)- Very unclear and unprecise work assignments lead to frustration on both sides- Very limited range of consulting services (only in Industry branch - 80% of the firm works for 2! companies)- Bottom up approach leads to meaningless and stupid work which has to be done by young consultants","- The quality and success of consulting firms is determined by the expertise and network of the employees,so investing in your employees benefits DIRECTLY the customer - happier and well educated employees lead to higher customer satisfaction, so try to putmoney into employee topics and IT infrastructure- Change the culture more to a feedback loving and encouraging work place","1.0","Syngroup Management Consulting"
